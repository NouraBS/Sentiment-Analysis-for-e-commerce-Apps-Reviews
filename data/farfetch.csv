I love the sales, the brands, the fast shipping and the payment options as well it hits all points on my list personally and I can very well see myself using this app for all my apparel and shoes and everything in between im so glad I found this app!",False

But reading the very bad reviews, I decided to just give it a try buying just the shoes. Well, two days later, got a basic email that my order has been canceled and shall receive a refund soon. No choices, no alternatives. Replied with a complaint and received a condescending and still robotic email saying that I was supposed to list my shipping country as Puerto Rico and not the US. Meaning, if you live in Puerto Rico forget buying here. It will force you to read their website in Mexican Spanish (I’m not joking) with no option for English or just regular Spanish. Then it will treat your purchases as if you were in a foreign country where you have to pay customs, duties, etc. even if the merchandise comes from another state (NY, where the shoes would come from). Then when you pay, your address is invalid because your credit card company uses the regular American format to validate your shipping address and PR is part of the US, not a country. I emailed the company to clarify that the address is right and that I couldn’t navigate their website in “Mexican Spanish” and more importantly, the credit card wouldn’t validate the purchase with PR as a country. Bad website and worse customer service. They have dumb robots doing the work of people and adults. Not worth it!",False

My dad gave the package and the package slip to the delivery man who scanned it and went off. Over the next few hours the tracking never updated to “collected” or to “shipped” so I contacted customer service asking when I could expect an update with all the order and return info in the email. They asked me it was scanned (it was) and then never responded. I emailed again they told me there was a missing package inquiry on my account. I sent proof that my package was picked up (lucky I have a video camera on my porch) that clearly showed the package being hand delivered and scanned to the mail carrier.

They cancelled my order and *so far the refund has not processed and when I go back to check on the item (cancelled at 6am checked app and dress availability at 10am for multiple companies including Farfetch) I see low and behold it’s still in stock - at a higher price now. I went to contact customer support - they were no help and the website crashed while writing a claim. I will try again but I am very frustrated and not optimistic right now. If you sell something at a price and then I pay for it, that price should be honored if the quantity is available. ^Note the discrepancy is not a decimal point on the price tag, my size is more expensive but at the time of purchase the price was all equally on sale to match competition and the designer’s price.

After receiving shoes from Philippe Brand Paris that were cheaply made and peeling after a couple wears, I reached out to FarFetch about what we could do. It took them over a month to get in touch with the brand. I had to follow up several times. Then, they gave me 12 hours to package up the shoes to send back for “inspection”. There was no guarantee of refund. Nothing said about the time it might take. And after waiting to hear from them a month, they just sent a delivery driver to my house (I wasn’t even home) without getting any confirmation from me in 12 hours. They also asked me to package them up in the “original packaging” 2 months after purchase, so clearly it’s a method to not have to compensate the customer.

The search, filtering and suggested items are really intuitive. The shipping is always quick and returns are seamless. Customer support also deserves 5 stars. 

The only thing keeping this from a 5-star rating is the wishlist feature. As someone who normally has a clear vision of what I want, I enjoy comparing similar pieces from different brands/designers. For this, I usually use the wishlist feature. Unfortunately, this feature is slow and buggy at its best. It takes a while to load the wishlist and removing items from it takes a while and sometimes doesn't happen. Worse yet is that when this bug occurs, it’s easy to accidentally remove items that I didn’t mean to. 

If not for this bug, I’d give it a 5 star rating.",False

I’ve never experienced such overwhelming incompetence from an order support team. I noticed that my order contained an unapproved surcharge, so I contacted support via email and phone and requested an order cancelation. They then waited until the item shipped the next day before responding that they would look into it. I called in and talked to a clueless guy who first told me that the order could not be canceled because it had already shipped, but he promised to help and asked me to call him back in two business days if I hadn’t heard from him. Then, Farfetch proceeded to overcharged me, in the wrong currency. I contacted them on the second business day, and then they refused to fix the charge unless I returned the order and then re-purchased it. With PayPal’s exchange rates, I wouldn’t even receive a full refund! Massive, rude, insulting waste of time and energy. At these prices, I’m absolutely furious. Terrible, terrible, terrible.",False

If your used to other online shopping options and might need to return it’s not worth it to buy from this company. I paid more for a dress buying it from farfetch than the designer because they talk about how easy their return process is on their website; this is not accurate. A two week return window is not for deciding you need to return something rather it’s for that item to be delivered back to the designer. And you can’t drop items off at fedex/UPS or anything like that. They send a currier to your house - sounds nice if you have the ability to be available at home during the day for a three hour window on a very tight turn around. 

They have beautiful items but I won’t be buying anything else from them because of the time and hassle spent just trying to navigate and the money wasted.",False

Mind you I called them before processing the return so that everything was properly handled. I never in my life experience such bad customer service and it’s such a shame I have to write this review because I really loved buying from them.

Honestly, I could fly to Italy and buy the Gucci jacket and get home before my order would arrive from Farfetch. And do not expect any special treatment or packaging for that matter. 
In addition, I recently tried to return a pair of Golden Goose sneakers that were a few days outside of the return policy, and they refused! Rafaela in customer service was unwilling to offer any compromise or understanding. Apparently she did not look at my purchase history before considering.

There is almost no inventory (I think a search for dresses - in any size - literally resulted in four items).  If they had more inventory it would be hard to navigate though, since you don’t seem to easily be able to filter search results (at least not by size).  It does seem like they have more bags (at least a couple dozen, from what I could tell).  They were all super high end, such as Hermès (>$25k used), which is great if that’s what you are looking for - but you could still probably find more inventory on other sites/apps.

As they get more inventory, and have to build up the app to make it useful once people actually have to search for things, I’m sure it will get better.  For now it’s kind of a hassle.",False

After first cancellation they’ve asked for a picture of my ID and picture of the credit card I’ve used. I sent it!. And it got canceled anyway second time. Third time it got canceled the next day after using Apple Pay as a payment with the same stupid explanation. What a joke. At this point I doubt it they have the items they’ve listed but would cancel your order and blame you instead of admitting they don’t have those items.

I adore the style and brand but at 3 weeks they developed a clear manufacturer defect. After only wearing for a short time, the stitching opened and caused an enlarging hole. I understand that luxury hand crafted goods can have defects and asked for an exchange of an identical pair since they were so new. I didn't want my money back just a functional pair of shoes since they were not inexpensive. However, farfetch denied me this saying it was past the return date (by 10 days to be precise). I sent a dozen photos showing the problem and how good the overall condition of the shoes were in otherwise (like new!) but they said that I could either send them back for repair to the partner shop in South Korea or they'd offer me 10% the purchase price to cover repairs. I didn't purchase from that shop...I made a transaction with farfetch and assumed they would stand behind their goods. After back and forth, when I did not respond to their offer in 3 days while mulling over the awful offer, customer service emailed me saying if they did not hear from me in 2 days then they'd consider the matter closed. I cannot give the customer service a worse review. 10% would only cover a fraction of such a repair- forget that we are amid a pandemic when many online companies are making exceptions or extending return times and zero cobblers are open in my area. Note: they also said it can take 3 months to get my shoes back. So now I paid money for a defective product which I truly love and just want replaced but instead have to trust will be repaired appropriately and also have to go without for months. I can't dissuade you more from using this site!!!!",False

463,2,RobxzNYC,,Disappointing,2017-12-17 02:08:24,"This review is about the app itself, not about Farfetch as a business. 

1. Haven’t read any mentioning of the extraordinarily long time it takes the app to launch. I timed it, 30 seconds until the landing page appears on my new iPhone 7! It’s in a league of its own. 

2. Will you let me favorite items only in my size? I don’t need to fill my favorite list to satisfy your algorithm while none of them has my size available. 

3. Will you let me click on the designer name ONE TIME to see their entire product list? Why do I have to SCROLL to the bottom of an item page first, click once to expand the designer section, and click once again to see the collection? 

4. I will not buy on Farfetch until you give me the personalized shopping experience you promised as you demand my sharing my browsing preferences openly, with which I’ve been particularly patient and consistent taking into account of the time it requires for machine learning. The one preference that I have yet it’s ignored is viewing items in the order from price low to high. I’ve shown no interest at all in seeing what products Farfetch recommends but you simply refuse to stop feeding me your recommendations! Technology not only allows retailers to track shoppers’ online footprint, but also empowers shoppers to customize what information they want to see and how to see them, which must be enabled by retailers but they don’t. The answer to retail’s future has always been driving the next new exciting product, so the fundamental issue can be forgotten, but for how long?! The fundamental issue is the relationship between consumers and retailers is a distrustful one rather than a mutually beneficial one.",False

Okay here is my feedback as a costumer who have had enough. 

I placed my order on June 1st. My order says preparing from 9th-14th. I have called FARFAKE costumer line since they told me that it was SUPPOSED to be delivered. 

Today is 14th and they are still preparing my order MIND YOU I only have on this order a pair of sneakers. 

The persons that I have been on the phone with have hung up on me, have screamed at me, have been completely the worst.

 One lady that obviously was a new agent because there is NO  explanation in her behavior even told that my order was not important because orders that were way more expensive and had more things had priority and that’s why my pair of sneakers haven’t been even prepared, TO DIE FOR those treatments towards me. 

Continued… SO today I have been on the phone with 5 staff members on the costumers line and they have been saying each one completely different things. 

So in my opinion and because of how I have been treated I do not recommend to you dear person that buys expensive things to buy from this app because 

1-They will sell every item, then later on will appear as available and then will NOT be in store and you PAID for it and you obviously would have to wait or be in a really stressful situation or ask them for a refund just because you wanted a pair of sneakers or a bag or whatever it is that you want to spend your hard working money on

2-You are going to be treated as 3world class citizen because they will not even care that you spend that much money on something 

3-SO recommendation dear human. Buy vintage or go to places where sustainable clothes, bags, accessories etc… are affordable and will be with you for a lifetime because of their unique qualities!

I emailed customer service about it, asking if I can contact the seller to exchange. Then he started the return for me. Then there was no schedule a pickup option in my account anymore. I know how to return an item from my account, I was just asking if there was a way to exchange! His mentioned he can book a pickup for me so I asked for it and never heard back. Then I called the customer service phone# someone eventually scheduled a pickup on the next day. But no DHL person showed up in the end! My friend had to drive to a DHL location and drop off the wrong item.

After returning the wrong item, I tried to order a similar item from another seller for her. I used a one time 10%  off code, however the order was declined due to their system error. So I called customer service again. This representative said I could go ahead place the same order without the promo code, they would manually review and approve the order and refund me 10% of the item price. Eventually the correct item arrived. I asked the same representative about the refund. He said that they couldn’t refund back to my credit card, it was store credit.

App developers, if you’re reading, please consider: 1. If I’m looking at a Balenciaga bag, enable shoppers to click on “Balenciaga” in order to be taken back to the list of items instead of having to click the button. If I’m looking at that bag and clicked on a similar item at the bottom of the page, I have to click the back button twice in order to get back to the list of items from that designer. It’s a PAIN. The toolbar at the bottom of the page also disappears so please fix that so that shoppers have a shortcut. 2. When I’m looking at the list of items from one designer, it’s quicker to be able to swipe left on the thumbnail and see the other pictures of that item. Please check out the Shopbop app. 3. If there’s a promo code to use, please specify which items qualify instead of having to add it to your shopping bag and find out it doesn’t qualify. Same for the website.",False

The window is always 3 hrs. So I picked 5 pm to 8 pm. Guess what? DHL does not work during that time! And guess what? Farfetch does not let you modify the pick up time! I’m stuck with re-scheduling with DHL and explaining the whole situation with them because I don’t have a DHL account. 2) Finally the package was picked up. Guess what? It got to the DHL warehouse and they told me the shipping label is faulty, when scanning the bar code nothing came up and they cannot ship it. DHL asked me to get a new shipping label. Now my package is stuck in their warehouse for 1 week because Farfetch still hasn’t got back to me. 

Be aware: Farfetch is merely consolidating inventories of different boutiques. And the boutiques scam people. They falsely accuse you of returning packages in a bad condition just so you HAVE TO KEEP IT.  I have never been this wronged and framed in my entire life. I shipped back everything and only tried on the shoes for 5 min in my bedroom because they are too small for me. I cannot believe the injustice I’m receiving and they are not willing to provide any proof or details. Just a generic returns policy and “we cannot accept it”.
