It’s my favourite shopping outlet and always my go-to for outfits/gifts etc. The app is so easy to use and every transaction I’ve had (until my most recent one) has been smooth and easy! The next day delivery is brilliant. I order frequently from here and I’ve never had a problem, returns are usually done quickly and no hassle. I purchased an item on 8th Feb which was a gift for my other half, his birthday is today and the item is too small, the 28 day return period ended yesterday but I contacted ASOS as they are usually so amazing and explained the situation, I would have been happy with an exchange or a credit note yet even though I’m a loyal regular customer that spends a lot of money with them they have refused to help me. I totally understand the policy but I’m really disappointed in this outcome as I run my own business and I look after my loyal customers as surely you want to take care of the people spending money with you and keep them happy? I get not having a refund but an exchange or credit note would surely not have been too much trouble. It seems greedy like many other big chains have been during the pandemic.

I am able to find something for any occasion and returns are so easy which I find really helpful for finding the right size/trying more than one option. I also love the range - plus size and items I love in more than one colour. 

Next day delivery has also been super for getting items nice and fast. Only complaint is that my last order took three days to get to me even though I have an annual next day delivery subscription. DPD are usually great, however I got a email from them this time with a picture of where they left my notice card saying they missed me but it was not my house and I had been in all day (Saturday 14th July). I was not able to contact them so thought it might be worth notifying you. They then said it would be delivered on Sunday and so I again stayed home all day and they did not attempt to deliver again.

2,False,3,2021-12-14 21:29:58,"ASOS is a very convenient way to buy clothes and is always the first place I look for stylish and affordable things to wear. After shopping here for a few years I just have to get the odd quirks off my chest.

Their photos are often highly misleading with models in awkward and often weird poses that give you no inclination into how the piece will look on a regular person. Adding to my distrust I have for what I’ll be getting (often relying on Klarna to try things on first just in case) I find items will have weird flaws in them I’m never sure how to feel about. Tiny pockets on a pair of baggy jeans for example. Oversized T-shirts that are tight. Black jeans that aren’t black at all or jackets costing almost £100 where the zip dismantles itself the first time I do it up.

But the thing that gets to me the most about this app is that while ASOS boasts 1000s of products to choose from they rarely have what I’m looking for. And this is coming from a guy who doesn’t ever wear “statement pieces” or stuff that makes me stand out all that much I just like them loose and comfortable.

3,False,4,2019-04-07 21:36:31,"I think you have one of the best online shopping apps out there (Zara are pretty good too). BUT I would LOVE to see how clothes look on certain shaped bodies, not the size 8 and below models who barely represent the hundreds of women who come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes, but the pears and apples and the hourglasses. I have the dreaded pear shaped body (I can wear a very snug 8 on top but usually wear a 10 and I am very much a 12 down below). It would be so nice to see a model who is a similar shape to me so I can get a vague idea of how the clothes will fall on my body and what it looks like. 99% of my returns to ASOS is because the items looks different on me than what’s advertised. And getting plus sized models won’t help either, believe me I’ve tried, I still  can’t get a sense of what a dress might look like on me.
The other thing is I often search through 1000s of items in one hit when I need something to wear to a wedding and all your models are so white. It gets so boring after a while to see someone who doesn’t have your skin tone wearing a dress you like often wondering ‘will this colour wash me out?’",fhfugiek,two things...

I Would like to say ASOS has one of the best systems of the ordering process particularly for one of the most busiest time - Xmas and, of course, the COVID-19.
It’s very easy, user friendly and enabling reviews including customers sending photos, this helps a lot for sizing of clothing and reassurance and suggestions of which beauty products to use.  
Delivery is v. good, keeping you up to date but, unfortunately, you have to watch out for Hermes just leaving parcels anywhere, where they can be displayed to the public eye. So,make sure you are at home that day of delivery otherwise it can be easily stolen.  A lot of people will agree with me on this. I have been a victim of this but not with ASOS, it was from a different retailer.
It’s very difficult also to complain to Hermes so ASOS if you read this please contact them on behalf of all your customers. Thank you",fruibat,The Whole Procedure of ordering from start to finish

Some times I feel like it is falsely advertised. On the description it will say that the model in the photo is wearing a UK 8 (which I am) and when I receive the item it looks completely different on me. Not by an inch or so - by plenty. However, the good thing is it is extremely easy to return and exchange etc. On the contrary, waiting for your refund really is not. It’s funny how there are good and bad yet I shop there quite often. I suppose if you know you’ll need your postage receipt even 3 weeks after sending stuff back you get used to this strange way of shopping. I would definitely recommend. Be careful though, brands that sell through ASOS often reduce their prices on their actual websites faster than here. ASOS likes to keep us on our toes.

It keeps in touch with the evolution within mainstream fashion while also veering off course to provide clothing options for those a tad more daring. I have never had an issue with any of the sizings, the clothes are always well made and fit exactly the way I would have hoped. I do believe I will continue shopping here for time to come.  

My one and only complaint with the application, is that when you search into a page with a particular item, the “buy the look” function is either incomplete, missing or not at all accurate; showing articles of clothing that have no relation to the style being viewed. Perhaps if someone proof checked this and moved similar items into the “things you may also like” tabs and reviewed the former, then I would see no reason not to provide a 5 star review.",Jordamurph00,Plenty of options - Up to date with fashion movements.

I ordered an item and applied a £5 voucher towards the cost. The voucher was not applied, but had been redeemed and was no longer available on my account. Looking back through my order history, I realised that it had happened to me on several occasions and my vouchers had not been applied and had therefore expired.
I then tried to contact Asos through the ‘chat’ service and have found it impossible to do so.

Firstly their petite selection is very disappointing. I can never find anything that I simply must have! They really need to take a look at their petite collection and give it a serious makeover!
Secondly their new no paper return policy may be great for the environment but it’s bad for your purse because they don’t always refund you for items retuned. What’s even more frustrating and infuriating is that customer service is either useless or non-existent. I’m still trying to chase a refund for items returned but still have not heard anything from them. All I can say is order items very carefully so you know you’ll keep them as you’re at risk for not being refunded.

A cart page should show what’s in my cart and how much my cart comes to - you shouldn’t be advertising random items (that I’m not interested in) that make the cart total look incorrect.

They do have a notify me when it is restocked, which works well, but can get tedious when your doing that for several items.

I was also told that from me returning the items to receiving my refund could take a maximum of 16 days...

1) Reviews. I truly wish people could review items they’ve bought, because sometimes things won’t be good quality as with any brand or sometimes an item will run large/small. I truly wish this was a feature, reviews are seriously helpful and informative.

My idea would be to add a section where you can put together some of your items from your 'saved items' list onto a manakin figure and see what your future purchases may look like when put together. This could make purchase and exploration much easier on the app as people will become more confident to buy the products as an outfit. This idea could also make the ASOS app, and its creators, better known as I'm not aware of any other app that has used this idea.
