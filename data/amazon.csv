I had many items on it and realized the item was cheaper if I had ordered it myself. I contacted custom service and was told to wait until I receive the item before they would give me the cheaper price. I’m figuring when I did receive it, the cheaper price would be gone and they wouldn’t refund or they count on a customer forgetting to contact them.  I canceled my five year prime membership along with canceling all subscribe and saves. Prime has gotten to be a joke, too. I loved the music. Now they want to you pay MORE to hear up-to-date good music by subscribing to their music service. The only reason I had prime was for the shipping and the music. Now we’re down to one and I’ve been finding better pricing on items I buy elsewhere. Prime is no longer worth it for me. So disappointed.",16/07/2019 11:13,amazon
1,wiser4it,3,FALSE,Unacceptable.,"To be honest, I can’t always differentiate between the app and the retailer’s flaws.  I can compare the app to the website, though.  I have a major issue with Amazon’s search engine, which usually ignores many of my search terms.   I have huge issues with the quality of the products and the stingy limitations it places on my ownership of music and audiobooks I have paid for and should own for my money.  Food stamps?  Check out the microscopic choices available to the poor, who can use their food stamps for almost anything edible, in regular stores. 

I have many irritations with the app, such as no dates on reviews (which we know are not useful because so many of them are simply bogus propaganda from people being rewarded for positive contributions), the app’s design, which is far more awkward and limiting than Amazon’s website.  

Both access points are aggravating in their inefficiency.  I was seduced by Prime’s free shipping but am growing disgusted by Amazon’s poor customer service, its obfuscation of information, its focus on selling the cheapest garbage out there, its deceptive vendors, its manipulative and half-useless navigation algorithms, and its apparent business strategy of wasting as much of my time as possible, and I feel that the app is a rather crudely implemented extension of the company and its deplorable values and business plan.

Its stupid! Because if you click the Missing/broken they ASSUME YOU HAVE IT EVEN THOUGH ITS MISSING. Theres no on site thing to review the company itself. Or file a complaint for its actual team. Then you spend an 1 hour on the phone with someone with an accent so thick you can’t understand them explaining you dont have the item! And it take them the entire hour to understand, for example, “i dont have the item i want a refund”
“You….dont have the item?” “No i dont have it” “ah well you can return it to get your refund” “I DONT HAVE IT” “Ohhhh!!! You dont have it, Let me see what i can do!” (30 minutes of waiting)
“Ah so it seems we can refund this but we can only do it to the site, maybbe the card” “i want the card refund. Its my money i need it” “Let me see what I can do…. you dont have the item???” “i dont have the item.” “Okay okay” (10 minutes) “you started the return process, yes? Can you return the item??“ “No.”(20 more minutes of basically explaining it in different words I NEVER received the item) “okay okay..

This “new” format and layout some times do not have a purchase button and only have a subscription button or neither. It’s to much like a phone app now. I’m sorry but i have a I-Pad, not a I-PHONE I do not want them stupid buttons on the bottom like an I-phone app. Also along the bottom of the window there is a black spot that appear when you first open the app and it also appear to be a notification window but blank. I have tried to tap on it, move it, open it, expand it, but nothing works, it just sits there covering half the screen. Also the right side of page is covered up or running off the edge. You can’t reduce size to make page fit, nor move it over to read it. I have deleted app and reinstalled to try and correct problems, and it may work fine or it may not.

Usually I can just click on the number of reviews next to the stars and it’ll take me to all the reviews, but now, it’s like it’s no longer hyperlinked and it does nothing when clicked on. So I tried the slower route which is to scroll down until you get to the reviews, but it turns out, when the app is bugging like that, you can’t scroll down to the reviews because the page just stops right after the price area. So no reviews to read at all. I try clearing my app history by swiping out and going back in but that doesn’t help. There’s no remedy right now for this bug. 

On the off chance you can click and read reviews, the pictures no longer fully display. It’ll just be the heading ‘Reviews with Images’ and a blank spot where the pictures would be displayed. When that happens, the hyperlinked ‘See All’ is also gone too.

The past few months have been nothing but ongoing issues. Oh and now apparently anyone can get free Prime shipping on $35 or more? Are you kidding me? What a joke. We don’t want video (that is riddled with ads and anything decent you have to pay extra for), music, cloud storage, GrubHub memberships, none of that. We just want fast, free shipping.

I also like the full picture view better than magnifying a portion of an image.  I find it more convenient using my computer’s browser because my finger is not in the way of images, only the tiny little cursor.

It’s like the location of each item is being mapped to the blank area at the far left, but *only* when navigating with the trackpad. After it initially jumps left when entering the tab bar, I can click in the blank area and will be taken to the cart. If I carefully move the pointer in that blank space, I can find the corresponding spots to click into the other tabs. As soon as I approach the actual location of each item in the tab bar, however, the pointer jumps to the empty space in the far right. It’s impossible to hover the pointer over any of the the actual items in the bar so I have to use my finger on the screen instead.

Why are they in my list? Good question… It’s because of a “pay wall”. (It’s a thing just look at Twitter.) The have an option for expedited shipping next day if you pay $2.99. If I want to pay for expedited shipping that should be an alternate. It should not appear in my primary method of filtering.

49,CowtownGirl76,1,FALSE,Unreliable search results and product ratings,"Considering Amazon’s vast tech resources and net worth, this app is a huge disappointment. 

One of the biggest problems for me is the abuse of the review system. There are products with hundreds or thousands of five Star reviews which are obviously fake. If you look at the users review history you can see the user has posted the exact same review for different products. How does Amazon’s AI not catch this?? 

Another bug is sometimes there are several reviews for the wrong product mixed in with the product you are viewing, as if the product IDs got mixed up at some point. For example, a fish tank might have multiple reviews and photos for a travel pillow. Totally unrelated products got their reviews mixed together. This means the average star rating must be wrong. 

Overall, product star ratings are unreliable if these issues are not fixed. 

A few other annoyances of the app are:

- They removed infinite scroll in search results. You are forced to click “Next”, and shown paid ads at the bottom of the search results. At least let us increase the number of results per page. 

- Filters functionality keeps changing. And there should be a way to set your own defaults for filtering and sorting.

For a company that has made record profits the past few years you would think they would be better at programing an app and ensuring a usable GUI.

There should be a way to add items from saved for lasted to a wishlist or to categorize items. The bottom control center bar is useless and ineffective. Having to triple tap the cart to fully view is exhaustive. The home page does not refresh frequently enough/follow searches (poor algorithm).

396,Robe4life,1,FALSE,It’s getting so bad,This app is getting worse and worse. I HATE that it fills my search results with things that have nothing to do with the search terms I put in. It means you have to scroll through more posts to try to find what you’re looking for and the app is laggier and much slower as you go down the list of search terms. Often times it just crashes or takes forever to load 2-3 searches at a time. But it has no problem shoving “recommended” products in your face that you never asked for. It’s become very much so not user friendly. The app used to be good but these changes the last few months makes me wonder if I should just end my Prime Account and shop elsewhere. This is just too frustrating to use.,03/04/2019 1:36,amazon
397,RayHAz,1,FALSE,Hate the new interface!,"Update March 2018:
I hate the new app on iPad. You’ve totally botched it, requiring me to go through many more steps to do things I usually did in only one or two clicks.

It’s sad, making substantive changes because a few snippy developers think something is going to be cool. Do you have a beta test group? One you LISTEN to? I’d like to be on it, so you don’t doink it up so badly again.

—— Previous Review, circa 2015:
I live 60 miles from anywhere, and love using this app to help me find things our local stores don't carry. I'm a Windows software developer, so getting my hands on up to date reference books is easy here.

I previously had commented about the kludgey Wish Lists feature.  The updated app's Wish List feature is WAY better now!  Some people might think it's too much effort if you only have one Wish List, but I love it.  I have a Books wish list, a Tech/Geek wish list, a Birthday list for things I'd like to consider for my wife/son next time around, etc.

Checkout is easy.  Searching is easy. And now if you're a heavy wish list user, you have lots of options!",25/03/2018 13:11,amazon

That’s understandable for customer support though, but the worst part in my opinion is the search feature, you can type in anything you want, but you’ll get things that don’t even relate to what you typed in.",22/11/2022 0:17,amazon

I’ve seen others having the same problems from New York and from New Jersey probably have some I’ve seen one post. Do you want to get my trust back then send me the next year supply for free

I go on with my life, come back to review something else- and low and behold there’s the product I’ve already reviewed 3 times. I’m done!!!!  I don’t have time for this. 
I’m just trying to help other people with their purchases and this app keeps deleting the review. Grrrrrrrrr 

Please fix this app????????
Thank you",15/02/2019 17:29,amazon

In fact I had made the request on the website to only be told I have to use a flipping app. Took care of it and deleted the app...tired of being FORCED to load apps instead of being able to use the website.,17/12/2020 23:37,amazon

4994,Ta4taful,2,FALSE,Worse and worse,This app used to be great but no more. First they took the drag to favorite feature away. Then the filters are useless and now you can’t look at an item and go back to the search without going all the way to the beginning. I use this purely for convenience nothing more. One of the worst shopping apps I’ve used.,14/10/2020 6:09,amazon
4995,Anderld47,2,FALSE,Getting worse with each update.,When reordering an item after performing a search the “buy again” button takes me to a matrix of other items I have ordered in the past. From that spot I have to go to the cart and select “Proceed to checkout.” Then I get another screen with “Place your order.” Not a very efficient system.,08/10/2020 18:05,amazon
4996,Megan Bolda,1,FALSE,What happened?,"App has always been fast. Recently the look of the app changed and it is very slow. Very slow. When I search for something, it only comes up in text form. No more pictures of the items.

Hopefully it’s just a temporary bug, but it’s completely useless as it stands now.",29/09/2020 0:45,amazon
