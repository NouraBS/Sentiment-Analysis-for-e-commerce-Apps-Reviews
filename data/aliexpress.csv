0,Do your research but great venders are available,False,5,"I’ve been shopping with Ali for over 8 years and I’ve had some bad experiences but very few. I’ve gotten great vendors to do business with!! Do your research and don’t just look for the best pictures especially when it comes to beauty products!!! A lot of the pictures are circulating from different websites and they are misleading!! You can ask for samples but that definitely doesn’t always mean you’re going to get that product they sent. Read the last few months of reviews and check out the pictures on that particular vendor. They always ask you to take a picture of the product and upload it so they can get a really great review and it drives business their way!! This is also a way to get some of your money back a few bucks like 20-30 dollars for your review and pictures. 

If you don’t like the product let them know immediately and try to work things out without having to file a dispute. Reason why, simply put you’re most likely going to be back and forth and if you don’t have sold proof that the product is bad or the company has a reputation for selling bad product you’re not gonna win that dispute and if you do it’s not gonna be what you paid for that product. Communication is everything, so is humility! Thanks",2022-02-18 23:33:59,Lady McHenry
1,My favorite app!,False,5,"I LOVE AliExpress! When I come across anything I like on other shopping sites, I always check AliExpress and usually find the same item or something so similar that any difference(s) is so minor that it’s unimportant. And the items on AE’s app are usually a far better price. I’m a visual artist and crafter and, if I can wait out the delivery time (which is sometimes only 2-4 weeks, but usually 1-1/2 to 2 months), I’ve found countless fabulous deals on supplies, tools, even DIY project kits. I’ve also been able to create an awesome wardrobe of stylish, cutting-edge clothing, shoes, accessories and costume jewelry, for remarkably affordable prices. I really needed to fashionably express myself after turning 40 and going through a divorce a few years back, and have been able to do so without wasting my money on fast fashion, fads or boring “middle-aged lady” clothes. They have “middle-aged lady” clothes if that’s what you want, but the possibilities are endless. And the app is so user-friendly. I’m getting married again (to someone wonderful this time) and have even found and purchased my exquisite, perfectly made wedding gown and reception dress, plus shoes and accessories as well as many of our decorative elements, on the AliExpress app. I can’t recommend this app highly enough. I love love love it!",2020-08-29 23:03:41,KarolinaDean
2,Good app but...,False,3,"It’s a great app and a great place to shop but not all sellers are cooperative. I just had a seller June electronicity/Junnuo tech. Store took their time getting back to me and was slowly helping me. It was like they were stretching the return limit so you’d end up with a faulty product. Then after I told them what was wrong and sent a video of the obnoxious noise it was making. They told me that “ it’s a normal sound my friend” which wasn’t supposed to sound like that at all, so they will give faulty advice as well. Very sneaky and unscrupulous. Many other seller have done the same or had another tactic. But I had no idea that 15days after you get product there’s no return etc. the seller was being politely unhelpful and ended up with a brand new product that runs like it is 15yrs old. They wouldn’t help and was being childish. This was just my last mishap with a seller I’ve lost so much money on this site it’s sad. I would highly recommend only buying once and a while when they have better prices or sales. But I would suggest you just go to eBay cause same sellers but they have to follow American rules and policies. So be very careful there are good sellers that don’t try to trick you but there are very unscrupulous sellers on this site as I imagine they did this to just me I’m sure they tricked others as well. I usually compare prices then if I have to order from here I will but typically go elsewhere.",2019-12-11 11:10:45,mitchkyng75
3,Be diligent in your research,False,3,"The old saying is true that if it seems too good to be true then usually it is. I have doubt that this app is no exception. There are a few things that I have received and found them to be a good bargain. But oftentimes in order to get decent items, you’re paying close to what you would in a store near you. I’ve found that often times companies will take pictures very close up to an object to make it appear larger than it is so when you receive it you are really aggravated that it is so small. No wonder it was so cheap. And finally, I’ve found that there are shops you must watch out for because they have marketed something as theirs only to find out they have stolen it from another artist in another part of the world and there’s not a whole lot that can be done about it. But I can’t help but laugh at the USA when they outsource their products to make a bigger profit because all they have done is given the opponent their secrets and they just produce it under their name and make them a competitor. I used to like this app but I’m not near as fond of it as I once was. Also, I’ve had to file a lot more disputes because of either not getting something or getting a defective product. Finally, the shipping has become much more expensive in the past six months. You have to be careful of that now. So it is what it is and you get what you pay for in the long run.",2019-09-14 01:57:39,Jennifer Denton
4,Very great app!,False,5,"I was a little skeptical about Aliexpress before i started buying, but let me tell you, Aliexpress is definitely worth a try! Now most of the sellers on Aliexpress are from China or out of country, so i would not go to them if you need your package in a speedy fast hurry, but if your just a heavy shopper like me and forget you buy things when you buy them (lol) packages are always a surprise! on most orders, the estimated shipping say around 89 days, but so far i have placed 14 orders in the past week or 2, and three of them have come in wayyyy before estimated delivery. I really like their cart feature, where you can buy one item at a time, or select only the items you want to buy in that purchase. i find it very convenient because on most apps you have to place orders altogether, but with Aliexpress you can pick and choose which items you want to buy. They have feeds where you can check out other people’s reviews about other products, based on the things you’ve liked, wishlisted, added to your cart, or searched up which, to me, is a very nice concept. Everything is priced so well and reasonably just watch out for shipping costs lol. Overall the app is great and i definitely recommend to most <3",2022-08-09 02:43:59,sweetiepie_SAVAGE
5,Great savings on carbon bicycle parts,False,5,"I recently started using AliExpress for name brand bicycle parts at a great price. So far I’ve received everything I’ve purchased from this website. Most everything comes from China so there’s an extra wait time to receive stuff. If you use the mobile app you sometimes can save a little extra then using the website. You’ll be amazed how much you can save from buying from China. Lots of things are brand name items and the items that aren’t brand the quality is real good. Most everything you buy in the US comes from Asia anyway. You just cut out the middleman. AliExpress is easy to use. Most all the sellers respond to your questions so you can ask anything before you buy. There English is a little broken so you’ll have to read between the lines. Just be sure to check the sellers feedback before you buy. You’ll want to be sure to buy from a reputable seller with a good history. I’ve purchased a carbon wheel set for $500 where the name brand wheels would cost $2,500. The ride quality is great no complaints. If you do have an issue support will freeze the payment to the seller until the issue is resolved and you have control to release the funds to the seller or get a refund.",2019-10-03 03:21:53,Hanale63
6,They scam US buyers please take these people down!!,False,1,"Guys please DO NOT buy from AliExpress I have made many disputes to let them know that my items have not arrived and they did not care at all! They told me that I have to return the items and, I’m just like how will I return the items when they did not arrive? and then they told me to show proof that it didn’t arrive and I did do that and they still did not care. They sided with the seller, closed my dispute and completely took my money from me.I also had another issue where I asked for a refund and they emailed me two months ago and promised me a $20 refund with no return because I’m a “valued customer” and they still have not given it to me so I contacted them about it and they proceeded to blame it on me and say it’s my fault that I did not get my refund bc I did not return the item when they literally told me I could get a refund with no return so once again they took my money from me. AliExpress has stolen about $170 from me I will no longer be buying from here again and I encourage you guys not to buy from here either I have also had problems where I have written bad reviews and they deleted them just so no one can see it I’ve also seen other people on the app say that AliExpress sellers are framing them and saying “if you don’t give me a 5 star review we will keep your money from you and not give you your item”which is so ridiculous these AliExpress people are absolutely disgusting.",2021-10-11 13:10:31,T E N N N N N N N N
7,Ali Express App Review,False,4,"For the most part the app works well as other apps of the same type. However, there are times I am looking for something and it totally misunderstands what I am telling it in the search. The other problem I see, is that there’s no way to track your shipment once it leaves China. I waited almost 5 months before I got my last order. Don’t worry though, usually it doesn’t take this long; probably due to the pandemic. Another thing that is very difficult to do, is to review stamps (for paper crafts/scrapbook) and metal dies, because they have the same name and it doesn’t not show if you are leaving the review for the stamp or the metal cutting Dies. The last thing that is very aggravating, is that when you’re order is missing still and you want to put a dispute an order, you have to put a dispute for each individual item in your order; it will not let you dispute the entire order and this is extremely time consuming when you have a very large order. There are boxes to let you check them individually or as an entire order but there’s no button that lets you do the entire order. And it’s the same when you receive your item; even if you get the whole shipment in one envelope. If these things get fixed I’ll probably will give it 5 stars.",2020-09-15 17:24:48,Ssodagi
8,Please read this review :(,False,5,"This is unreliable, I lost so much money from stores not refunding like they promised.. l lost at least $200 total. 
A SELLER canceled my order of $112.. and when I tried to open a dispute the highest refund I could request was $16!!!!. so I canceled dispute and decided to wait the 48 days to try to get a full refund.. The seller has ignored every attempt I’ve made to reach out the them.. I’m still not sure what’s going to happen with my money.. I’m hoping for the best. I’ve super patient, and I have ordered A LOT from here.. I’m hoping for better future experiences but I’m super disappointed and overall feel let down. The prices are going up too, which doesn’t make sense for a lot of the items.. They are honestly about to lose my business unless something changes.

Here is how AliExpress works. They have different “sellers” and “shops” that sell items, nothing is 100% guaranteed.. it really is a gamble with your money because there’s some stores that have fake reviews, and some of the sellers that I’ve come across seem like they try to scam you or trick you so they get money and you’re left trying to figure out how to get your money back.",2021-05-15 22:48:01,Lalalalalala0707
9,Sometimes confusing,False,4,"There are a lot of sales and the discount coupons are very confusing.  I collect a lot of points but don’t use them too much. You never know if you have the one for the store you want.  I usually just don’t buy things because of that. 
The coupon plus a 0.01 sales  items appear to start at 2 AM here. Needless to say I never get any of them. I guess they aren’t meant for the customers on the east coast or mid western states of the US. It’s the middle of the night here.
There is also a problem with items advertising one thing and when you get to the page it’s three or 4 times more expensive for that item. You get a much smaller , scaled down item for the advertised price. Also they will call it cashmere and then when you get to the site and check the specs it says polyester. So I don’t buy that either. That’s illegal in the US. It’s called bait and switch. I’ll go find it elsewhere. It may cost a little bit more but I know for sure what I’m getting.
When I find a good place that has quality items for  a good price I tend to stick with that store. They may cost a few dollars more but I know they are a reputable store and I won’t get junk, it will be something I can use or give as a gift.
I have bought some very nice things on the app",2020-01-01 22:16:12,Rhett7427
10,Pathetic,False,2,"I am giving this app and company only 2 stars because AliExpress services does not help you with any of the disputes that you may have with sellers, and it takes the sellers forever just to get back to you if they even care about getting back to you. AliExpress company does have a lot of products for sale but when it comes time to purchase a item and the sellers take your money with no problem but, when it comes to the refund of it back to you when you don’t receive the item it can become very problematic to the point that you may have no choice but to call the authorities in the country in which you are having the problem, the biggest thing that AliExpress needs to fix in my opinion is the way and speed the cancellation of an item works and being able to remove or delete the items from your “ to be paid “ list my opinion is that AliExpress needs to become a lot faster when it comes to helping people with disputes and forcing the sellers to refund money faster, along with updating the ability to remove items from the - to be paid for - list if you no longer desire it, but the biggest thing I would like to be able to see changed is the ability to see all of my past purchases on a separate list so if I want to buy it again then I can find it easier",2021-08-20 08:10:44,Night Goth
11,My review USA collector,False,5,If you pay attention to the reviews and pay attention to the specifications you can almost 100%depend on the quality of your item. I say almost only because there will be fake and false ads wherever you shop online and shipping and packaging heavily depends on the sellers and how much care they take….again pay attention to the reviews and your good to go. I have had one damaged item out of a large number of items  and it was not worth taking action it was clearly shipping abuse not on seller or sites behalf was barley damaged easily fixed. To sum up my over all experience as a collector from the USA. Prices are unbeatable and if you pay attention to what you buy and the details of what you’re getting this is now my main source and would be a huge added value to any serious collectors arsenal of “hook-ups” lol I personally love using this site and very much recommend. Also customer service on sites behalf has been very satisfactory. They do want you to revive quality product through the sellers and will work with you through issue you could have…thanks guys and gals at  AliExpress  and the sellers!,2022-06-05 02:17:38,kgrett
12,Great place to buy things!!,False,5,"I have been buying from Ali Express for years and they have gotten better every year! I live in the States and it used to take 1 month or more to get anything from Ali and other similar sites. The last 2 years it has taken on average 2 weeks to get most items, sometimes 1 week like recently, surprising with the whole COVID-19 shipping delays Ali has done great for me! Now if I need something name brand very quick, in a day or so I have to hit the normal other shopping sites so I can get an item in a couple days but if you plan ahead just a little and be a little patient you can get some great deals on things, just be smart and check out the seller and feedback and number of sales and star scores and you should be just fine. Ok gotta go, ordering some more stuff from Ali so I can get it before Christmas... 
...are you still here, seriously, did you really read this far?? Good for you, now stop reading and go buy some stuff, hurry, now!!!
Oh yea don’t forget to use the coupons you see on the site and on the sellers page, they will save you a little money which makes it even better!! 
Ok by...🤗",2020-12-04 21:41:27,Old Atari nut
13,Really Decent App,False,5,I have tried several different apps such as this one and this is my favorite. So far I really haven’t had trouble any except you must learn to be very patient with the shipping time. I have received everything as I ordered and as stated. My advice to anyone who is ordering is to Read The Specifications Always and Reviews Carefully. Also make sure the photos are of Real People in the Reviews because some of them are the store owners. Just Read and the same item might be cheaper with another seller but check the store out and look at the shipping cost. Check sizes and dimensions for your own understanding of accuracy. Also understand on clothes that the Chinese are much smaller people so most clothing runs much smaller. What is nice about this app is You Can Ask the sellers questions about the products if you have any concerns and they will answer you. Overall I think this app deserves a 5 star rating. Just remember so many people are ordering from these apps now that their postal system is not as efficient as ours. Be understanding of this and except to wait at least 30 days for your order.,2022-04-30 18:00:42,missymjh
14,This app is amazing,False,5,Most apps like this that are hella cheap like wish for instance is not so much a joke but nothing you buy from wish has any kinda quality to it what so ever but I must say the saying you get what you pay for is NOT the case with this site.. I have ordered all kinds of things from phone cases to bathroom shower curtains and rugs to stickers for my ceiling and everything I have received from this site and paid a little bit or nothing for has been very very good quality a lot better quality then what I paid for I have to say I was very very impressed and will most deff recommend this site to any and everyone and if you have never checked it out it’s worth a few minutes of your time to do so you won’t be let down I promise that.. it might take a week or so to get the stuff because it is coming from china but I noticed a lot of the shipping is free and they are faster then wish for sure… all In all I give this app 5 stars for sure more if I could and I will continue to order things from there until they aren’t here anymore which hopefully never happens thank you AliExpress !!,2022-06-25 19:19:02,casseymarie12
15,"Easy Shopping, Wide Selection, Phenomenal Deals",False,5,"Very convenient and easy to use app. I’ve used it for about 7 years for cheap accessories, small things like earring backs, synthetic wigs, plush from my favorite series, and more. The deals are phenomenal, and the jewelry quality has always been good, often better than or just as good as costume jewelry at popular American stores (Charlotte Russe, Forever 21, Claires) for a fraction of the price. The lack of additional shipping charges on most items makes it even better, and sometimes purchasing via the app instead of the website yields additional discounts. For example, I made 7 jewelry purchases totaling $16 and it got me 5 necklaces, 3 chokers, 2 pairs of earrings, and an elaborate two piece ring. Many items also have picture reviews from customers, and you can ask questions directly to vendors to make sure you're getting what you think you are. 5/5 I would definitely recommend.

(Note that it is wholesale from China so 4 weeks to arrive is typical (though it’s faster or slower in some cases); see the est arrival date for each item before purchasing)",2022-06-08 21:51:20,Thomeka
16,Great APP(If you know what you’re doing),False,5,"Needless to say, the app is great. I get to buy products from vendors across the globe for a decent price. I absolutely love the app, however if I was someone who didn’t know how to properly shop online, I would be a bit overwhelmed because many sellers have the exact pictures displaying their items, some of which could have ulterior motives HOWEVER this is no major problem because AliExpress does refund you your money if you aren’t able to receive the product you bought. I’m a new shopper on AliExpress & received my product in three weeks, the time it took to come isn’t that much of an issue to me because I always account for waiting at least a month for my orders but that’s just something to keep into consideration, so I advise you to order your product at least a month before u need it. Besides this the app Is great, I get major discounts from buying wholesale and I get the privilege of buying all sorts of things that I wouldn’t get to buy in my country. I love global shopping sites, and I think this is one of the best ones there is.",2022-02-08 02:53:47,Liyah'
17,Please fix your search filters!,False,3,"I must say, I’m absolutely addicted to this site! I love the little 3 for $1.99 and $5.99 sales that are constantly running as you can sometimes catch some pretty good items if you’re quick! (Even if you don’t, you don’t end up spending much so it’s not that big of a waste) my only gripes are the pricing can be very deceptive. Shipping prices seem to be determined by the sellers as well so you’ll see a lot of price gauging with shipping prices which can be quite annoying. One seller I wanted to buy from charges nearly $2k just to extend the shipping for one of their already expensive products. I also wish the app had stronger filters or the ability to filter out certain results when searching for something. It’s difficult to search for things because the results always show me random unrelated things that I either search for and/or wishlisted in a previous search, or it’ll just show me completely unrelated results. For some odd reason, the app loves to randomly show me adult products and toys next to random results for reborn baby dolls which always makes me insanely uncomfortable. If anything, PLEASE fix that. Other than those things, the app is pretty okay.",2022-11-28 00:29:07,Aubreechan
18,this app is garbage,False,1,"pure GARBAGE. i added about 15 items onto my list and pretty much all of them had the new user bonus. i figured i would buy them all at once but the new user coupon stopped me from doing so. so instead, i tried to buy just one item with the new user bonus, like it said. it wouldn’t let me at first bc the total was less than 20 on apple pay so i just used my card which i guess messed it up somehow and then i went back and some of the items became full priced, but some still had the bonus. i tried doing everything in my cart again but it didn’t work so i just bought another item with the new user bonus. i used apply pay for this item and it cancelled both order because they both had the new user bonus. now it won’t let me buy ANYTHING bc of security reasons when it’s really just a problem with the coupon. this stuff takes months to arrive and i’d like to get it done but i haven’t even been refunded for two purchases and i can’t buy anything until those purchases have been refunded or i can get rid of the new user coupon which isn’t even able to be rid of i don’t know how to use it and it’s getting annoying pls i want my 38 cents back and just to order some stationary before valentine’s day i’m not even that mad i just want to buy my stationary pls help",2021-12-27 02:39:42,arishshhsh
19,Obsessed,False,4,"Very reliable. I shop from this app at least twice a month. I’ve purchased just about everything from here from face products to jewelry and electronics to shoes and sweaters. I have just 3 complaints. 1) The gold coins I’ve spent several months collecting have so far been useless. They’re exchangeable for coupons (like $2 off $15+ orders) good for very select stores (not all).  Basically, 13% off, which isn’t bad at all except that in the 3 or 4 years I’ve been a very active member, I’ve only used a coin-exchanged coupon like twice. 2) Very limited penny deals in exchange for x-number of gold coins are available every 24 hours. If you’re on the west coast, that’s at midnight. For me on the east coast, it’s at 3am. The one time I tried playing the penny deal, the second it struck 3am, everything was sold out before anyone could count to two. 3) The freebies the sellers advertise, anyone can apply for them and just once from two different offers so you can’t submit a request more than once for one item and you can’t submit more than two requests a day. I have been a member for more than 5 years and have not won anything from AliExpress.",2021-05-13 00:39:45,Keychain83
20,Tips to shop with aliexpress,False,5,"I’ve been shopping with AliExpress for several years now. The app is pretty decent, sometimes it’s a little clunky but it’s easy enough to navigate around on but I wanted to add my two cents on the reality of shopping here. Think of it like many shops all under the umbrella of Aliexpress, like a mall. It’s a portal to all of these shops and it does offer buyer protection but you have to do your due diligence. First, expect slow shipping because the goods have a long way to travel, slowly. Second, don’t spend anything you are unwilling to lose (do your research, some stores are incredibly safe but there are questionable shops). When you get a package, take a video WHILE you open it. This will serve as proof if the item is damaged or missing parts of the order. And finally, communicate your with seller if there is a problem. Many times they will offer to make things right without intervention, but if things lead to a dispute do not close the dispute and/or accept a refund off of AliExpress. Remember, check reviews, look at photos from buyers, and be smart!",2021-06-08 20:41:44,Noctu
21,Terrible customer service,False,1,"I ordered some merchandise in February and I guess I had forgot to put in the address number, which on my part was my fault, but they did not know until the package came to the US in March, so they returned it to the sender. Then since then  the Corona Virus was starting to appear in the US, my seller couldn’t ship the package back to me for some time. I asked for updates every month, because I ordered some other things from China from other apps and they came in. I later asked for a refund in the beginning of June because I no longe wanted the merchandise  and the seller kept telling me she will talk to the courier. Then she wouldn’t get back to me and when she did she told me I will get the refund when the merchandise is returned to them, but my tracking said it was returned to the sender back in April, so I asked her to clarify again. Every time I kept asking for her to update me she said she would check but i never got an answer. Now it is almost August, so this has been ongoing since the beginning of 2020. Then I tried to contact customer service but they don’t have any live people, only bots and they don’t even have a number that I can call for help. So I can’t even contact Ali express but only the seller who is not satisfying my customer service in any way. This was the first time I ordered on Ali express and definitely the last time.",2020-07-24 02:43:53,nimra222
22,Ash,False,1,"You do not even receive most of the merchandise you order and then they don’t refund you or give you any merchandise in replace of your original order. They mix up orders all of the time. I received a bunch of plastic pieces for some one named, Rosa, and paid $91 USD for 6, 5-piece sets of lingerie. I never received them.. the seller refused to admit to the mistake and just stole my money, instead and ALIEXPRESS PROMISED that would not happen and they promised that it would be taken care of, needless to say, it was not. What they are doing is illegal. The store, “VARSBABY”…just stole my money, no refund, no merchandise. It took 6 months just to receive the plastic pieces of “Rosa’s”. I uploaded evidence of the original shipping label, the US LABEL AND THE PLASTIC PIECES. ALIEXPRESS JUST STEALS YOUR MONEY AND DOESNT SEND YOU YOUR ORDER AT ALL!!!! This has happened about 7-10 times now to me. I will never buy on here or especially from the Chinese sweatshops EVER again. What you do end up receiving? It is normally broken and they refuse to refund you in that scenario, also. They put you in touch with a robot who does not have the ability to communicate until you beg to speak to some one alive..and then they lie to as well and tell you you’ll get the merchandise or refund but you do not. Don’t count on any thing that you order coming before a 6 month time frame, either!",2021-12-08 19:37:48,Ashleigh Saxen
23,It’s okay. Stay aware.,False,3,"If you love shopping on these kinds of “wish” apps, this is times 100. I’ve bought plenty of stuff from here, it takes a while to get most items, I do stress..a while..and also many of most items are not exactly what is shown, they tend to show nice quality or items in cotton fabric and then you get thin silky type definitely cheaper material etc. so keep in mind, if you’re very strict with high expectations, I don’t know if this shopping app is for you but with the cheap prices, I’d recommend trying it! I have gotten some good deals on jeans and stuff but it’s also very misleading when it shows off coupons as if it’s easy to get and use them, it’s not. Really read the rules because it’s very very specific which is frustrating. Coupons are close to impossible to get, unfortunately. I do feel like they’ve gotten a little better as time has passed, I recently ordered and got my stuff within a week and both items were as shown, I was happy with my order so I guess a huge piece of it really comes down to the seller! This app has a never ending amount of items, the most random items, little gadgets etc. so I love that, I can get hooked for hours!!",2021-11-27 09:48:39,BrittanyMarie22291
24,Love ❤️ AliExpress: I Visit Daily,False,5,"I love AliExpress, I love the way it has mini games and freebies. It has so many categories for discounting, it gives me the control on how I want to spend my money and the particular discounts I want to utilize. They also have sellers/stores Who sponsors special events and give app users contest and special games/entertainment that ties to the shopping experience and it makes it more exciting. They have the option for live shopping, I’m not really into that. But usually every item has a demonstration video which is very helpful. I totally suggest at least downloading and trying it. Be patient because it is a big app with a lot of options, and it’s going to take a bit of time to learn how to navigate it and learned the rules. That is really the only con I can think of in, my pros and cons list, took time for me to understand what was going on in the app, in order for me to LOVE ❤️  the app. But if you have the time-I definitely suggest trying AliExpress.

But when it comes to a quality problems, Many times I got defective products, I took the time to make fotos and videos but I noted aliexpress dispute service always try to favor the seller and not the buyer and they keep asking you more and more proofs until you tire of wasting your time and decide to just give up. You can have an idea that they give you only 3 days to provide what they ask and when they ask something from seller they give him 7 days (that is totally unfair). When a item does not arrive they tell you to go and ask to your logistics and ask them to issue a paper saying that that item did not reach to them (They are crazy, nowhere in the world logistics issue any such kind of paper and no one has time to do that) And even they can see clearly in the tracking details that item never delivered or reached to the buyer. 
Believe me you will not like to wait 2-3 months for the product and after you have to lose your money so go and find other sites where at least you can have a good and faire customer service.",2021-01-31 10:24:27,Talkasia
26,Biggest crooks on the App Store,False,1,"I ordered a few hundred dollars worth of stuff. A few days later, I immediately saw that my purchase was shipped to California and I live at the edge of the East Coast—I’ll let you guess the state. I reached out to the seller and they denied it. We went back and forth sharing pics and tracking until I filed a complaint which took Aliexpress forever to even read the details of the case because this went on for two weeks and before they asked me for screenshots I had already submitted twice.  A long while afterwards, I discovered my identity was stolen and my card info used. I contacted the company to tell them the charges on my account were fraudulent and I was going to report my cards as stolen. When I did so, I got new cards and tried to give the company another chance. This was December when my info was used and I’ve submitted countless appeals and verification requests to prove I am the owner of the cards:sending photo ID, bank states, pics of the cards, my banks’ judgements, and police reports and they still won’t unrestricted my account. They are the most incompetent company I’ve come across. The worst customer service teams. All they do is lie to end the conversation. One star is too good for these con artists. They protect their scammers better than clients. They are a disgusting company who has never reached out to me or my bankers.",2020-09-15 13:02:26,LadyA-
27,Gotta watch these guys......,False,2,"I’ll try to make a long story short yes it is a great place to shop they do have everything if you can come in contact with the right seller and not have to use customer service, my seller did not communicate so I had to use customer service they are responsive and they are very nice to work with but in a nice roundabout way they have the sellers back making you think that they have your back but they do not I got screwed on something that was Supposed to take 12 to 20 days for delivery took 60 days Telling me to keep waiting patiently they ran me out of purchase protection time so I could not get a refund and the seller got paid quickly if something is not available it will not tell you but they will take your money and you will be waiting for your item that does not exist the only way you will know is if you ask them if it’s available I ordered the same parts from Allabiba And got them in 3 days Bear in mind I also had no tracking information other than order has shipped and they could not tell me where my package was or should I say wouldn’t tell me so don’t think customer service has your back in that situation in a dispute refund situation because they do not they will milk it until purchase protection runs out and then say sorry",2018-09-24 23:32:46,stopher71
28,Delete app not just yet!!,False,3,My first time with aliexpress.  I know most of this comes from China.  The WISH app is exactly the same as aliexpress.  Mostly come from China that’s why they are very cheap and take a really long time to ship out and receive order.  It took a month for my order before they shipped it out.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  So don’t believe or trust the picture they post about product.  This is my first time ordering and the picture matched what i got but the accurate size of it is bad.  The size didn’t actually fit my phone.  I figure i start with something small and cheap before i really start shopping.  But my concern is…. How many times do i need to purchase something before i get something right.  One problem i saw when i was looking for items… they post the picture i searched and the price but when you click on it.  The price changes depending which part of the item you want to buy.  A lot of people are happy from other reviews that i read but having a bad experience from the get go sets the tone for the next one.  Paranoia kicks in when you hit buy thinking if you’re going to get your money’s worth this time.,2022-09-29 23:57:07,BigD1469
29,Security issues from terrible update,False,1,"I have bought a lot from AliExp and had mostly good, but some awful experiences (empty packages and damaged or faulty goods that I had to pay for, as their dispute process only allows their vendors to upload evidence after the initial complaint) BUT after the last update my credit card was security blocked. The two ways to solve this are firstly to delete and reinstall the card, but you can no longer delete the card in the app and you have to use the Ali Wallet website, which constantly goes to a ‘system is busy’ message when confirming your email address, so it cannot be used.  The other way is to lodge an appeal. How do you do that? You have to send a picture of your passport or drivers licence, PLUS a picture of the front and back of your credit card (showing your signature, of course) PLUS you have to send a copy of your bank statement, with account numbers, balance, spending and deposit record, employer deposits so they know where you work, etc. Call me Mr Suspicious but that sounds like a perfect setup for identity theft/bank account hacking.  So my card is blocked, which means they don’t want my money, and unless I give them all the information to hack my life then I can’t buy anything more.  Anyone else find this suspicious?",2022-07-15 23:25:43,PiercedDevil
30,Overall l love it,False,4,"I really really love shopping from this app. I love finding unusual stuff. I also love the variety of things to buy and the different stores. I wish the app will make it mandatory for sellers to mail the items within 3-4 days. It takes some sellers 10 days to send the item/s in the mail. There were a couple of sellers l had to message and then they sent my items right away. It’s like they totally forgot, but they did take my payment. Also, while it takes 3 weeks to a month to receive items from some sellers, others take 2 to 3 months, which l find absolutely unacceptable. Also, sellers need to be told to protect the packages no matter what the item is. Some sellers place items directly into a plastic bag and the items arrive damaged, broken, bent.
Another thing that it’s not okay in my opinion, are sellers claiming to sell original items, but they turn out to be counterfeit, and they are charging the full expensive price of the real item when they know it’s not an original ítem from the company the manufactures it.
I do love shopping on Aliexpress, so l do plan to continue shopping here.",2021-07-20 00:23:31,Nchama
31,Great Shopping App,False,4,"Many different items and products that are offered. If you plan on purchase items Please use AliPay, AliExpress will ensure that product(s) that are purchased are as described and shipped in proper form and in quality and customer satisfaction, they will NOT release the monies paid to the Seller/Vendor(s) until the Customer is satisfied with all concerns regarding products purchased and guarantees, and also submit by pressing the CONFIRMS button which is when you as a customer gives AliExpress the go ahead to release the monies to the Seller/Vendor

The only problem is that:
 Many Sellers/Vendor DO NOT include installation instructions and/or Product information, for some reason I’ve noticed this with a high volume of overseas products. So if you need to have the proper information you will have to asks for this information from the Store you purchased your items from, which I strongly believe should be a Set Standard Procedure by AliExpress  also the Shipping Packaging should also Standardized. Overall AliExpress has done a TERRIFIC JOB ensuring that the Customer is being Properly Serviced in mostly all aspects of their overall online shopping experience.",2020-10-09 23:04:13,Makalena
32,Aviya,False,4,"Hi,
The Ali express app is good and has been improving in the last years from time to time. 
There are still some improvements which I think are required and will benefit the customers and make the use easier, especially for those who are ordering a lot.
When you go to your account, to “shipped items” in order to confirm shipments which were received, after you confirm packages from one seller, you get to a page which lets you either move to rating the confirmed item, or back to your account.
When I get shipments, it’s usually many and from different sellers, so when I want to confirm several packages from different sellers I have to keep going back to my account, to the confirmation page, roll down again to the right package and confirm again. This is don’t for each seller separately. Which is exhausting when you get about 10 packages altogether. They should either allow confirming several packages from different sellers in parallel (by marking with a v in each accepted item which the buyer wants to approve), or add another option after confirming which takes you back to the “shipped” Page, where the confirmation is done.",2019-03-07 14:19:26,aviya-sh
33,Hate! Hate! Hate!,False,1,"When i started using ali's i was so happy with the prices but then when it actually arrived i was furious first of all, I paid for extra shipping because some stuff i got were gifts for my sister and i wanted them to come before her birthday, FALSE some of her gifts arrived after and i was really furious next i ordered like 11 things and i have to return EVERYTHING except for 2 things due to the fact that they were either scratched, broken, cheap quality, ripped, not as described, sizes were different etc you name it they did it and then whenever you would try to return it or simply get your refund they refuse to do it!!!! they say they cant do it and that they will give you discounts or refund you like barely half of what you actually paid and its just really really frustrating and i dont think i have ever received bad customer service as much as this! I am still in the process of trying to refund half my stuff!!!!! Ali Express literally just eats your money and doesn't give it back. The service it awful and terrible there and I hate it!!! I have received more stress from them than i ever have in my entire life!!!!!!!!!!! And they just wont listen! Then whenever you text them they leave you on read and there is literally no other way to contact them like i cant call, email, anything!!",2019-11-08 05:20:57,ACEEEEEEEEEEEEE ❤️❤️❤️❤️
34,Love Buying From AliExpress,False,5,"I’ve been buying from AliExpress for approximately 10 plus years.  A lot of sellers has come and gone. The good sellers are the ones that ship merchandise out within 1-2 days. The ones that wait until last day or hours to ship out are most of the time “bad” sellers. They sell items they don’t have or there is issues. They make buyers wait on items they’ve already paid. The buyers monies are tied up waiting. Some make you wait and the last day find out there is additional freight charge if you still want your purchase. Some seller has shipped different color or size ordered. They know buyer won’t ship it back, seller gets rid of unwanted color or size. AliExpress do have a lot of good sellers, honest good sellers A lot of good sellers out weigh out the bad. I will continue buying.

AliExpress customer are great if you have to consult them. They are the go between on issues and problems. They work to resolve problems. I thank all the customer service workers. Thank you.

35,Beware of fraudulent sellers,False,3,"AliExpress auto-confirms receipt of an order, and disables the “Leave Feedback” button after 30 days of auto-confirming a purchase. Fraudulent sellers are taking advantage of this feature to scam naiive and trusting buyers. I made a purchase on Nov 11 and a few days later I noticed the tracking showed shipment was canceled. I contacted the seller and they asked me to be patient that the order will arrive. They seemed nice so I trusted them and kept waiting for it to arrive. I would periodically check back in with the seller after the order still hadn’t arrived and even after three months the seller still told me to keep waiting. By the time I realized I had been scammed and that the seller didn’t actually ship the product, AliExpress had already auto-confirmed the order and the Leave Feedback button had been disabled. I feel so stupid because I now realize this was precisely what the seller wanted — to stall by asking me to wait so that I would neither be able to dispute the order and request a refund, nor leave a review of my experience to make other buyers aware of their scam. This is the reason there are multiple fraudulent scammers on AliExpress platform. Buyers beware!!",2019-02-14 04:31:35,buyer review
36,Happy but unhappy,False,3,"I’ve used AliExpress for numerous years now. I am very loyal to aliexpress. If you look at my history order you’d noticed how much I’ve constantly order from aliexpress. Up until Aug 22, 2019, I made an order, but cancelled it right away because I’ve used the wrong credit card. Instead of refunding, I got charged. I have spoke to Crissie, customer service, and she was convinced that I was not charged and cannot refund me. I was very upset. I even showed her my bank statement that it was definitely a charge. I know how a charge and a refund looks like. I couldn’t do anything, and she wouldn’t do anything. But instead continuously claim that I wasn’t charge and to rest assure that I will get my refund. So, I have decided to call my bank. They have looked and saw that I did got charge, and there was no reverse for the charge as in there was no refund. So, I had to open a dispute to get my money back. I am upset that she was so convinced I wasn’t charged, and tried to tell me to rest assure that I will get my refund. LIES! Is this how they actually get your money? BUT, even so, this incident won’t stop me from using Aliexpress. I’ve always been loyal to Aliexpress and I will continue to be loyal.",2019-08-24 21:27:40,Beckyy yang
37,Needs improving stability,False,3,"It’s a relatively good app, but needs improving features and technical stability. It keeps crashing and stops responding so I have to uninstall and reinstall the app each time it crashes. That happens quite frequently sometimes daily and sometimes several times a day. As I open the app and starts counting down to show adds, this is where you can’t click any icon as it stops responding. This issue of not responding to any touch still persist while though it has been going on for a very long time now and I still need to remove the app and reinstall it to be able to use it.
Also, you cannot get technical support as it’s always unavailable. More importantly, out there is an issue, there is no customer service. There is only an automated response machine which is frustrating when you cannot solve your problem and there is no human being that one can refer to for support of any kind. The robotic response is so annoying and can’t help. I was never able to get help. AliExpress need to place employees who understand English to support customers like any other decent business interface.",2021-09-04 13:54:29,Sherry_Al
38,Love the camera feature to find what you’re looking for.,False,4,"Like the app, wish online version worked more like it. Would like for the app to go back to where you left off instead of starting from the beginning- so annoying... like when you confirm an order came and when you’re finished it doesn’t go back to where you left off it you have to go clear back to the beginning of your orders and scroll through in my case, several pages to get to where you were, just go back to where you were when you decided to confirm your order. It now hangs up after you confirm, and you have to go clear back to the beginng or start over. Everything seems still the same.
When I leave a review it says it’s busy to come back later and review but when I go to the beginning of the site to look at my orders it does say that it was confirmed. It’s annoying.

And that chat bot! When I exit out of it I want it to stay gone not come back at every page when I go to the next page! It’s the most annoying and not at all helpful.",2022-01-21 16:01:32,Mapdshopper
39,"Cheap, good quality, sorta sketchy",False,4,"This app is awesome for saving money. Most of the stuff on here (I said most) is a lot cheaper than it would be anywhere else. Stuff takes a bit to get here (usually a month or two) but it’s worth it. I would definitely recommend doing your research though. Look at reviews and if there are very few that are all 5 star and don’t say anything then I’d stay away from that item. This app is home to some sketchy people so please please trust your gut and don’t automatically go for the cheapest item. Most stuff I’ve bought here is actually decent quality. There have been a few things that have broken or been sucky but overall my experience here has been good. This app also has a problem with making some things sexual (most agere stuff). If you are looking for agere stuff on here (especially onesies) then please be careful and only shop when you’re big. There is some over sexualized stuff that really shouldn’t be there. All in all, it’s a really good app. There are just sketchy peeps you gotta watch out for.",2022-08-13 15:03:35,Scarygorlreviewer
40,Fantastic Website!,False,5,"I love AliExpress! It has all the up to date fashion at super low prices! They also sell electronics, car parts, jewelry, shoes, office supplies and more. You can upload a picture of anything you are interested in buying and can almost always find the exact product on here at a fraction of the price. Sometimes you can find an item similar to what you were looking for that you like even better! I’ve been buying from AliExpress for a little over a year and the low prices and great quality make it addicting! You won’t be disappointed and the sellers in the individual stores are always helpful answering any questions about the item prior to purchase. Most items on the site have FREE shipping as well! A+ app! Can’t go wrong with AliExpress. You do have to wait for items to ship from China but it is minimal. Most items arrive within 7-21 days, and again with free shipping in most cases. Give AliExpress a try but uploading an image of something you’ve been interested in purchasing and see for yourself!",2019-06-18 02:12:50,Aggie90Lucky13
41,Unreliable selling platform and customer support is a joke,False,1,"I have been using Aliexpress for almost four years.  Unfortunately, they have not improved a lot on how they handle orders that go wrong. Which, for shipments from China to US, happens quite a lot. I have recently dealt with situations where the seller pretends to have an item to sell, then they accept the order, they pretend to ship it and then, after one week, no shipment happens. Or with shipments that get clearly lost in some airport in China. What a normal e-commerce would have in such cases, is a clear communication channel to handle disputes and customer satisfaction. Instead AliExpress uses some robot interface to handle customer requests and when the customer is becoming exasperated he is finally put in a chat with some real customer service person, who usually tells him that the case is being investigated and will get reprioritized. The bottom line is that, even in cases you have not received the merchandise - and you will never receive it - it takes weeks if not months to get your money back. My recommendation is to use AliExpress the least as possible, always use a credit card for purchases (thru AliPay) and at the first sign of wrongdoing dispute the purchase with your credit card company directly.",2020-10-26 23:52:57,555-Marco
42,Upset,False,2,"I’m upset with this app and with his customer service if you have a problem that needs to be resolved by a real person you just can not fix it because they have a program call Eva for customer service and there is no way for you to reach a real person that you can explain your problem. I have spent 260$ on my last purchase with people and from 22 items I just received two of those items. For the rest of them it says that they have not left the country yet. It says I have to wait 2 more months to receive my items but in Teo months I will not be living on the same place so I can not wait to months for them. But I can not talk to a customer service representative because they don’t have a real person to talk to. This is just upsetting.  I don’t think is a bad app but it does has a terrible customer service when it comes to a real problem.

This is an updated most of the package where lost as it was obviously the support team never helped me to get my money back. They said that after waiting to month and never get everything I had no right to have my money back... when you think that they can not do it worst they come and surprise you. They can do even worst.",2020-07-03 13:51:56,Amiisupset
43,Lot can be improved,False,5,"the searches are dramatically manipulated to attract people with low prices by extra garbage piece store owners include with  the items like searching for iphone and results include converter adaptor price in search results.

There are some Honest store owners which cannot be pin pointed with general star system of grading in this 21st Century . Some owners purposely keep canceled items until shipping period expires although they don’t wanna ship, which will drive you crazy as your fund is hold until the period expires and cannot be sure to buy from another seller cause you don’t wanna have two.  Cancelled items shipping period should decrease in half unless seller confirm to aliexpress he/she will ship in the original period otherwise its a trap and waste of time of buyers.
Very few only I came across asking for extra than the published price for shipping. Don't buy from them, either they are cheaters as I said earlier to get on top of search results or they seriously dunno how to count shipping in that case they shouldn’t be selling.",2019-02-15 08:29:29,Fenfinolhu

AliExpress prices allow me to order needed items and have a sense of security and peace of mind that I can in fact afford them. The very same products sold here sell for twice to about four times as much money if I bought them from American retailers. While I fear and do not understand international trade rules and regulations, economic trade wars, or individual +/- corporate greed, I am thoroughly grateful for the ability to buy things at affordable prices from people across the globe who are also happy to sell what I need and want at prices I can afford.

I believe without Aliexpress I wouldn't have been able to find most of the purchased items here. Got car accessories, electronics, decoration, vaping kits, shoes, jackets, leatherwear and even plant seeds. The Chinese market is very diverse and competitive, and as a customer i can only be thankful for gaining access to that. Special thanks to the Aliexpress case team for handling disputes in a fair and professional manner every time. Edit: removed two stars because the app does not allow you to revise a feedback. If you hit 5 stars by mistake or leave feedback once you receive an item and after using it you find out that it's completely useless you cannot change what you had already wrote yourself. This does not really make any sense and is counterproductive. Seeing how aliexpress pushes users to leave feedback, even rewards them to and how customers react often leaving feedback for receiving an item not for using it I would keep two stars off the rating until it is rectified.",2022-05-11 04:23:55,Yquitos
46,Great site,False,5,"Clothes are extremely cheap and affordable. The only downside is that the shipping takes extremely long. That is expected though since it’s being shipped internationally from China, russia or some other foreign far away country. Still, if you want to stock up your closet with great clothes on sale, buy from here. There are some great sellers that offer faster shipping than others. Personally I love shopping from SHEIN; clothes there have great quality, it’s cheaper so you can buy great pairs of clothes in bulk, and shipping takes around a week or so while other stores take up to a month. In this case, when you have a great seller with longer shipping, you’ll have to be patient and switch your strategy while shopping on this app. For example, instead of buying summer clothes during summer, do your fall and winter shopping instead so that you’ll have a whole new wardrobe ready for the upcoming seasons. The same can be done during winter and vice versa. This makes shipping and time no longer an issue.",2019-08-31 16:44:45,A-Quito

48,Love it 🥰,False,5,I’ve just started using Ali a few months ago and love it. Do your Research and buy from reputable stores with amazing reviews. It took me 2 weeks of research before ordering my first purchase. I’ve only had one bad experience in the last 6 months since I started ordering on this app. Must be have patience when ordering. Take time to navigate site and learn how to communicate with sellers. Read descriptions carefully before contacting seller. Ask questions before you buy. Be kind and mind your manners. Sometimes they use translation apps that makes communication a bit confusing. Have patience and ask they explain differently if you don’t understand. If you get your item make sure your write a review and confirm you receive your goods so seller can get paid quickly. If you’re good to them they’ll be good to you. Take notes on your favorite sellers and don’t forget to favorite the item and follow the store for new arrivals and coupons. Happy shopping 🛍,2021-05-01 06:31:06,Roxiefit

If you don’t mind waiting, this is the app for you. I’m a very patient person. I understand we are living in a pandemic and things are slower now than usual. Some things come in two weeks, some things come in two months. It’s ultimately up to you and how much you’re willing to pay (or not pay) for shipping. Some stores even offer shipping within your country so you can get it within days. I honestly believe anyone who complains and cries about having a horrible shopping experience on AliExpress just wasn’t shopping responsibly and smart. Check the stores ratings and reputation.

The issues I have run into were a minor fix as many of the store owners are consistent in communication. There's a mobile app as well as a desktop site, however you're more likely to enjoy the mobile app, because I've noticed that ""mobile coupons"" don't apply on the desktop site for the same items listed in my shopping cart on the mobile app. Even with that I see no reason to complain. The user interface is friendly and easy to navigate on the mobile app and it's honestly more convenient. There are always featured deals, as well as a ""For You"" section which localizes your preferences and suggestions. Overall, I'm fascinated with this app and recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind waiting a minimum of two weeks-month for their items.

One thing I don’t like is that seller get over a lot. You’ll have images for an item that’s completely different from what their actual selling. Try to look at the views so that way you’ll see images of what the product actually looks like. I’ve been on here for over ten years and still make horrible purchases. Also be prepared to get taking advantage of from buyers. Some of them know the product isn’t as described. It’s easy for them to deny your return on this app. Better yet there hasn’t been one time I received any refunds requested. I’m dealing with a situation now. I purchased human hair and the seller sent out synthetic hair. My refund was denied which is bazaar.

Jewelry, purchased at least in Turkey, practice deceptive practices through semantics. Apparent, this is not enforced. Let me explain: I purchased a man’s ring, that the Turkey shops website advertises as Diopside(Zultinite). No where in the website(s) do they even mention or imply is not a natural stone mined in Turkey, or the simple truthful statement “Lab Created”. I found out through a local jewelers of this. Another shop tells a whole story about Zultinite, jewelry and mine. Then advertises Zultinite rings, No mention of its Lab Creation. Yes, these gemstones have identical properties, but that is not the issue. We have every right to know upfront what we are shopping for. It is about buying with confidence and trust. This is called deceptive practice. In US. If I buy a diamond ring that is what I get, Not a Lab created one, unless, I want that instead. No word playing. This should be a major concern to AliExpress, which needs to enforce this wrong practice.",2020-07-15 22:37:48,Goldcoin68
54,Beautiful Moissonite and Hair Accessories,False,5,"I have ordered quite a bit of Moissonite from this site. All of it has had the certificates. Also it is of a higher quality than I have been able to find on other similar sites such as Wish. They usually only sell G or lower and typically don’t offer certification very often. When they do you pay more than on AliExpress and it is typically only the stone. I found a D color magnificent 3 stone 5 cttw ring on this site with the paperwork and paid less for it than I did on that other site for just the 3 stones with G color and certificates. Plus I got free shipping!! I LOVE AliExpress! I have also found beautiful barrettes, headbands, hair ties, ribbons and brooches. If you are into BLING you can find it here. I also just found out there are ways to win points by playing games and making purchases. Those points can be turned into $$ off your purchases and it has nothing to do with getting other people to sign up.",2022-07-27 23:58:12,happydancechance
55,Additional features needed,False,4,"Apps needs to include function for buyers to knock sellers off from their personal view, or have a marking system to remind the buyer of bad experience in past. Though Aliexpress is good, some sellers are certainly not. I want to be able to mark off those misrepresenting the products they were selling, or sending in items different from what they showed in the pictures, so that I won't repeat the same mistake of buying from these sellers. Giving them bad reviews is not my thing. I rather simply not give them my future business and move on to other sellers.

When searching with photo, apps cannot organise similar products in any particular order. There is no options to view by relevance of price, when item search is done with image. It is unable to detect the postage price, so one would have to select the product to reveal the postage. Time consuming to compare total price like this. Only many sellers show as free postage on front page, but this is untrue when u open into further details of the product.",2020-06-08 11:35:28,"7"" bird"
56,It All Just Depends !,False,1,"There are some good sellers but unfortunately there’s A LOT of scammers on here that are selling products that are NOT as described so what they do is the send you the product tell you if there’s a problem to contact them but not to leave a bad review, they’ll claim they’re going to send you the “better” product but they DONT ! Then the sellers will ignore ALL your messages! But of course AliExpress has a horrible “Buyer Protection” so after awhile it expires and then you CANT EVEN GO BACK AND LEAVE A REVIEW TO TELL OTHER BUYERS TO BEWARE! To top it all off they have ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE “customer service” they don’t actually help you or tell you to go to another department & you end up weaseled out of your money without having received your product!!! You just have to be soooo careful because you don’t know what type of seller you’re getting! The ripoff potential is just far too high ! The worst seller there is Lumiere Hair & Their Fraudulent owner Tony who lied and swindled me out of money when they sent me fake product and claimed they sent my order but they were really just running down the clock so I wouldn’t leave them a bad review !!!!! I waited for over a month and they sent me a hair net and claimed they don’t know how that happened !! TOTAL SCAM!!!!",2018-12-09 05:17:44,MayaMillionss

The ordering process was so easy. The retailer immediately thanked me for my business and confirmed the correct shipping address. I appreciate how informative the seller remained through the  entire process. I was notified of when my bundles arrived by the seller as well.  Sincerely, I enjoyed their promptness. I am going to refer my colleagues, family and friends to “MEETU Hair.”  They have been awesome to do business with.  I have included photos of my hair. I am so amazed at how my hair held up through the heat and curling. Even though my bundles were straight 28 inch, once I sewed them in it all felt so full considering how thin my bundles were with other retailers from the pass. I order the multi part closure. Can I just say that the length is perfect and it blends so perfectly. This hair is universally appealing to all of my hairstyle needs. I am seriously satisfied to say the least.",2019-04-01 01:21:25,Adhanon
58,Love Aliexpress!,False,4,"Been shopping on Aliexpress for 6+ months and I love it. Great prices for decent quality items. Takes awhile to get items though. Two months or more sometimes but not always. Not sure if that’s normal or due to the pandemic. Regardless if it’s something you don’t really “need” and just want it, it’s worth it. Aliexpress also protects its shoppers from sellers that scam or don’t fill orders, as long as you open a dispute in the correct timeframe. Personally I’ve only had to do so once, and the seller was the one who refunded so closed the dispute without Aliexpress getting involved. The only other “bad” thing is sometimes the item gets shipped and then lost. Which again, as long as you open a dispute in the correct time frame you will get your money back. I’ve seen others complain about dispute policy and not getting their money back, but I don’t see how, unless they didn’t follow instructions and rules. Over all great app! I will be a long time shopper of Aliexpress and I definitely recommend shopping there! Hope this is helpful   :-)",2020-07-08 07:57:28,Rmhalte55
59,Be careful and read the reviews.,False,4,Pay attention to the reviews of other buyers as you will see if they are getting entire shipments and are satisfied with what they ordered. I primarily order items for card making and have gotten burned by a couple of sellers.  They refused to refund my money so I’m keeping a list of who not to purchase from. Once it was my fault as I didn’t know how things worked. They don’t have very clear directions as to how to order then once your order arrives to declare its value to you. Are you pleased or not?  Leave your feedback. I didn’t know about any of that. I didn’t know about how to reach a seller if the order wasn’t complete or damaged. Or if I wasn’t satisfied with the order what to do. The Alibaba company doesn’t make it very clear to newbies how to do things in my opinion. That’s why I’m leaving 4 stars instead of 5. A couple of the dies I’ve received weren’t sharp making them useless. Most were wonderful.  I continue to look forward to seeing what is new from Ali Express in the future but buyer beware!,2019-09-05 20:57:18,Silverneedle63

I never could find a hair company that had hair that doesn’t shed and feel this great I had this hair for a year and till this day this hair is very soft. I done mad a closure wig with it at first, then into a frontal wig & all i do is reuse this same hair and people will ask me all the time when do I get my hair from and I will tell like this the same hair i had from last year all i did was wash it and it came back to life as soft as you brought it again. Now every year I just buy my hair from this company. I love the price for this hair and everything. This hair is very nice and very affordable.

61,Aliexpress combined shipping failure..,False,1,"Aliexpress will steal your money. This is the worst and most frustrating company to deal with when things go wrong/ don’t arrive. Their new forced “combined” shipping has OBVIOUS logistics problems, and when they give you a single trackint number for things that were supposed to be combined at some point in shipping, but that for whatever internal reason failed to do so, and when you don’t receive parts of your order, it’s IMPOSSIBLE to explain this to them. They will rule the dispute against you and keep your money with no product. Days and hours or your life and time spent disputing with these people, on chats, providing evidence and proof from packaging and whatever else you can find, and they still rob you because their logistic problems are IMPOSSIBLE to explain to them. I was robbed for $30, online you find stories of people who experienced worse and lost more. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. They are no longer safe or reliable to American buyers. The combined shipping ruined the entire experience, and they are STEALING money at this point with no course of resolving the situation. Frustration and stress is all I’m left with, robbed of time and energy.",2022-08-04 10:14:38,Liljmia
62,Tips for shopping on Ali,False,5,"AliExpress doesn’t have to be full of scam purchases! If you know how to shop, you’ll always get great deals and good quality items!!
I’ve been on AliExpress for a few years and have made some mistakes. Here is how I’ve managed to get a loot better:

1. When you shop on there make sure you always arrange your searches by most popular/most reviewed so you can see reviews and ratings, as well as items people have mostly purchased (seriously you can see over 1000 buys and reviews for one item:)

2. Do not buy anything unless there are picture reviews. If you do, be cautious. There are products that have over 300 photo reviews so you can go through each photo to make sure it’s what you want. Most products on AliExpress use photos from outside sources that don’t nessasarily reflect the actual product. So photo reviews are really important.

3. When you find a product, scroll down to see if you can find the same one (on the related items) for cheaper. I’ve saved a lot of money looking around. The more you look, the better your chances!

4. Look at the sellers ratings. The higher their ratings, the more legitimate their products are

It’s about being observant and looking around! Be cautious and pay attention. 
Once you get the hang of it, Ali is one of the best apps you can have. I’ve saved so much money on items I’d have otherwise bought for twice the price. 
I love AliExpress!!
Happy shopping!",2019-09-18 18:58:19,Mumu_Lukw
63,"SAVE MONEY, GREAT SERVICE, NO RISK SHOPPING",False,5,"This app lets you take advantage of overseas pricing instead of the stores. Ok I don’t like that manufacturing has been given away to other countries with cheap labor, but since they need jobs too I might as well buy directly from them and save the middle man mark-ups. 

There is a no risk guarantee from Ali Express and they will enforce customer satisfaction. The products I review are only ones I have received.  

I’ve seen pictures of the items sent to others but  some customers are happy with less quality. So look at the pictures carefully and judge for yourself. Only buy if you see a picture of the ACTUAL item. I don’t like that sellers can post pictures from any magazine or designer site, then copy it without posting their own pictures. Often the item looks nothing like the product being sold! I’ve heard of a dog bath arriving that was 3” - for a doll house!

Don’t trust every seller and every product. Learn who is making good products. Some hit and misses, but overall a great opportunity to save money. I have bought things I cannot afford in the US market. Ali Express makes this possible. 

Finally, Ali would do well to insist on full refunds when the quality is poor. That way you’ll eliminate the scammers. Some sellers just send junk and get away with it. We cannot get a full refund. Return shipping is almost $100 for dresses - so obviously no one will return anything! Full refunds are necessary.",2019-06-28 02:31:10,Dad snores
64,So Happy with Aliexpress,False,5,"I found this app on reddit when I asked about why all these cute brands I was seeing on Instagram sold the same stuff. Someone told me the clothes were probably from Aliexpress. WHAT? 
Cut to a month later and I’ve learned that pretty much anything that’s not a name brand is probably on Aliexpress. ITS ALL A CONSPIRACY lol!! 
I’ve bought a ton of stuff on there and had mostly good experiences. I usually steer clear of shops with little feedback or scores worse than 96%, but I’ve still found great products from some when I did! 
When I first got on the app, I thought I was only going to find cheap products (I mostly buy clothes). But no! A lot of this stuff is good quality and the sellers I’ve experienced have been very responsive. I’ve returned a few items easily but not many have disappointed me so far! 
I completely recommend the app, but please check some reddit guides on how to navigate it before buying anything. And take advantage of the new buyer coupons!",2020-10-31 04:27:17,Mokimoko
65,So Far So Good,False,5,"I have only placed 2 orders so far and on one I had it sent quick within hours and the second well I am still waiting for the “processing” going on day 6.5 so I see that Aliexpress doesn’t care for the stores to be slow about processing the orders and sending out the goods and Aliexpress will cancel the order for me if the store takes too long So I appreciate them looking out for me So I am really liking Aliexpress So Far So Good i will definitely update my review when I receive my orders or if I have to reorder from a different store I only wish I lived closer to China so that my Shipping was not as far to go 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ update I received my first order from China to California in 10 days from Passion E-Bikes with great customer services by Wendy there she sent me all the information I needed to be a 💯% Happy Customer So a Huge Thank you to Wendy especially, but also to Passion ebikes and to Aliexpress for such a great working app with amazing prices unbelievable really great stuff 👍🏽 👍🏽 Cochise231",2019-05-02 07:33:47,Cochise231
66,So far so good,False,5,"So far I haven’t had any problems with Ali, I am very cautious when buying from any online sellers. There are some that lie and mislead. Facebook Marketplace, beware, If they describe something to good to be true, trust me!!! Don’t buy. Ali so far, everything has been as described and delivered pretty much on time or sooner. Will buy from Ali again with comfort that I will get the item I bought. Update; I have been buying from Ali for about 3 to 4 months now, most of the items I have received, have been true to description , packaged well and shipped on time. Great prices on pretty good quality items. I shop a lot, it could be a problem,, Ali is one of my go to apps I buy from, daily. It’s legit.

Update; I continue to shop on AliExpress and for the most part still am satisfied with if my buys. Yes there are a couple of bad discriminations of items, you just need to read reviews and use common sense when buying items.",2022-09-07 19:25:57,Micofun4u
67,AliExpress customer support Service,False,5,"I love how customer support service handle any disputes that are not resolved with the seller & buyer (reasonable explanation) and the protection plan that they offer.  I’ve been shopping with AliExpress for many years and had good and bad buying experiences with sellers. 
Bad sellers are usually the ones that are scammers  and selling things that aren’t described on their pages such as brand, color, descriptions,  stealing other website’s pics to put on their page, etc. Good sellers are the ones with the legit brands, descriptions that match on their page, and providing you with details. 
I gave it five stars because AliExpress customer support service made shopping online safe, reliable and being fair along  with protection plan. Because if it weren’t for them, I would of loss money and products would not be delivered as promised or an item that I didn’t order was shipped out instead. Thank you AliExpress customer support team",2018-03-24 20:36:54,bingopingolingo
68,BEWARE!!! Scammers selling on here,False,1,AliExpress not for the customers. I purchased 4 items from a seller and he sent them to me and all 4 were defective. I contacted the seller and he stated he would refund me. After a week I emailed him again he said he wanted pictures of the items that weren’t working. I sent him several pictures with different angles showing him it didn’t work. Another week goes by and nothing. I contacted the seller again and he never responded. I filed a complaint with AliExpress and I kept getting the same response “still waiting for seller to respond” weeks later. Then they closed the complaint in favor of the seller after almost 6 weeks of going back and forth with AliExpress. I emailed them pictures of the defective items and they kept dragging it out just to side with their seller. I lost out on almost $20 but it was a lesson learned for me. I closed my account with AliExpress and deleted their app off my phone and never again will do business with them. If this is how they do business where they have fraudulent scammers selling non working items and then don’t respond to emails and AliExpress does nothing but condone the behavior then I want nothing to do with those deceitful thieves.,2018-07-17 04:45:14,HeideW61
69,Decent Experience,False,4,"Overall my experience using AliExpress has been pretty good, except not all sellers are honest and good. I got my money stolen once, here’s the story. I bought a hoodie, it was around like 20 dollars, so fair right? I waited around 4 months for it, I ended up contacting the seller since the tracking number and everything just disappeared & wasn’t working. They told me that they would send me another one, but never did. I opened a dispute and discussed the issue with them, again them telling me they would send me the hoodie again and with a new tracking number. However, what ended up happening was they removed the product from their store and ended up just taking my money. I couldn’t open another dispute because they thought I got my product, which I didn’t. I ended up contact AliExpress themselves, getting my money back. 

Other sellers are super sweet and actually care about the products they give out, which I greatly appreciate.

Haven't had any other big problems with the app though!",2020-01-13 22:08:16,narcodaisy
70,Watch out  buyers outside of China.,False,3,"I purchased a pair of boots but the seller sent me completely different boots by mistake. I contacted the seller but they didn’t want to pay for the return label. So I disputed. Aliexpress decided make me pay half for the item that I did not order. I appealed  twice. Online customer services were saying that they totally understand my frustration, not to worry. I will get the full refund. But at the end I was told that the item has a value that’s why I have to pay for the half of the price for something that I didn’t order.  The wrong boots look ok but the ankle area is too tight and it hurts although my legs are quite skinny. So I can’t wear them!  How Aliexpress makes buyer to pay half of the price for the wrong boots!! I thought AliExpress stands for the buyer but MAKE NO MISTAKE! They are on the sellers side! Only way to resolve this issue is to dispute from my credit card. They have a different common sense. I have been enjoying purchasing from the site. But I must be much more careful to spend money here….",2022-08-01 16:53:48,Fumsicle
71,AliExpress,False,3,"Love the amount of items available and prices but had to take a few stars away because 3 of my orders never made it pass the original countries customs because of an error on the sellers side.  When I tried to get a refund or figure out what to do about canceling the order, I kept getting put back into the automatic robot loop the app uses on your phone which was NOT helpful!!! It was REALLY frustrating and cost me more time than what it was worth. Then I have to wonder if the credit they say they issue really actually makes it back to my account because I haven’t seen it yet. I use the Wish app and have never had these types of problems… it would be nice if they could create some type of Ali cash like the Wish app does so that if you have this type of problem, the response could be more timely.  
So far most of the items I have ordered from the site I have been pleased with.  Read the reviews though…. I have found that companies with bad reviews have definitely earned them!!",2022-02-25 20:31:44,JAWKLWBLWAFW
72,"Overall handy, easy to order from.",False,4,"It’s frustrating they limit both your wish list and you cart. Also, they don’t seem to have an order history search either, which I would use constantly, and it would help their businesses get reorders. Please note that while I list buyers beware… MOST OF THE SELLERS HERE ARE HONEST and I have had an OVER POSITIVE EXPERIENCE! Now, the warnings: Sellers are allowed to be dishonest (click bait!) and keep selling. For example, many imprint S925 on plated items or items containing no silver at all. S925 LEGALLY VERIFIES a product in many countries as being genuine silver. (Not plated!) Another example, GENUINE leather means absolutely nothing and this common misrepresentation seems the rule rather than the exception. It can be hard to discern if is actually PU or real leather, even when checking reviews. Finally, one must always be cautious of bait and switch. I have had this happen a few times!! Read reviews!! Many may be revealed there and save you trouble.",2022-04-30 13:02:13,Funkybluesgirl
73,"Terrible, they scammed me",False,1,Never received my order. I understand that you buy the product directly from overseas but when the order is Lost in transit or the seller does something sketchy you will not get your money back. Recently I had an order that I never received The seller never worked with me in reserving my issuing. I felt like I was talking to multiple different people. I submitted claims with AliExpress and the Postal Service. I was emailed written proof that the Postal Service lost my package and I showed it to the seller but each and every time they disregarded me and told me to contact the Postal Service for my order. It’s been a month and I still never received my order. They refused to either refund me or send me my order. Not only did I waste my money but I wasted my time with the back and forth trying to dispute with them. AliExpress dispute claim is a joke. You do not get your money back for packages not received. I am extremely upset and this company should be blacklisted for not even trying to help me find my package. Honestly I feel like I’ve been scammed it’s not the first time it’s happened on this app. Worst Customer Service team ever.,2022-03-21 02:21:59,XDarkro5ex
74,"Solid app, easy to use once you learn some quirks",False,4,"The app itself is good. Tracking your product is sometimes sketchy because of international orders but the app has always been up to date compared to the website when it comes to shipping. The thing I don’t like which is not exactly the app makers fault but should be regulated by the app is this: you can search for, let’s say a Gundam model kit. You’ll find a storefront that shows you the model kits but will have a crazy low price. When you click on it and go to what is usually labeled as “colors” or “styles”, that’s when you see the store front also lists a pair of nippers used when building Gundam kits and those nippers are the crazy low price while the variety of model kits can be 7x the cost that was listed when you originally searched. It’s kind of false advertising with the old Bait and Switch. It doesn’t take long to spot this though, and again, the app itself is solid and reliable.",2022-01-30 01:39:19,PCGamerguy
75,App needs a lot of improvement,False,2,"The search feature is glitchy at best. Not all results show up, and it’s impossible to search using pricing. These features are essential and need to work correctly and they just don’t. I don’t like all the promo notifications that I get from sellers there doesn’t seem to be a way to turn them off collectively even though I’ve unchecked the seller promotions option, and have to do each individually. I’d like to be able to place things in my cart for future purchase without being hounded by sellers on why I haven’t checked out. Also the fact that I’m limited in making wishlists is a big reason why I end up having to use the cart as such. I’d like to be able to edit my cart after I’ve clicked the pay link, but instead of being able to do that it sends the items in my cart to a separate section of items that have been unpaid and there is no way to edit them once they’re there so I end up having to cancel the unpaid purchase and redoing my purchase to be able to add or remove things from them.",2021-04-10 00:31:57,BeautifulMess74
76,Combined Shipping,False,2,"I initially liked the combined shipping but lately it has been a nightmare. 1 package, with many items, was lost. Another, with many more items in it, was returned to sender.  Both were horrible to deal with. I had to figure out which items were in these (not easy when the Order ID number is the same for every single order (seems is more a customer ID than order ID).  I then had to reach every Seller/Store to debate whether my items were coming or not (not likely with lost and returned packages)…. Then had to go thru dispute process for every single item.  Then, when trying to re-order everything, sellers raised their prices or things I very much wanted were no longer in stock because of the time it took to resolve shipping issues.  I am no longer a fan of combined shipping or, at very least, not a fan of the resolution process for these.  I would like to remain a regular AliExpress shopper so I do hope simpler options will be available so these transactions can be as simple as they should be.

77,Love AliExpress!,False,5,I have had many great purchases on AliExpress. First I was just shopping on their website but recently decided to use their app & it’s been just as great!  I’ve only ever had 1 bad experience due to getting a machine that was not as described but that is not the fault of AliExpress.  All of my other purchases have been great except for some ultra long shipping times but that is not the fault of AliExpress.  I have bought quite a lot of different things & everything has been great.  I would suggest if anyone is concerned about getting something that is not exactly as shown to ask the seller whatever questions you may have before buying.  I have also had a few purchases that were lost in transit but every time I’ve needed to open a dispute to get a refund AliExpress customer service has been really great at helping me.

79,SCAMMERS/ Buyers Beware Please,False,1,"I never write reviews…in fact this will be the first review I’ve ever written in my life. This has to be the worst online shopping experience I’ve ever had in my life. The sellers are money hungry, cheap and don’t care about their customers. I bought something and it came late which is fine but I ended up not liking it because it looked used and damaged so I asked for a refund which their store stated “refundable”. They refused to take it first (they were also acting very immature) and when they finally accepted, I paid for shipping and they told me they received the item. After that they blocked me on messages and I was not able to get my money back or contact them at all. I tried contacting AliExpress but everything is automated so nothing was resolved. Their number leads to voicemail and the “email” they provided was not even registered. This whole thing is a scam. Please be careful. I have been fighting to get my money back for 3 months now. I guess this is a lost cause because there’s no one I can contact. I don’t even think there is even real customer service for this company. Buyers beware!",2021-08-12 22:36:00,jadelynn95
80,My love for this app is OVER 9000!,False,5,"I’m really into anime/gaming/collecting things. This is my go to app to satisfy my fan-girl needs. I’ve bought many posters, stickers, bags, a couple plushies etc and I’ve been 110% satisfied each time. They also sell a lot of cosplay outfits/wigs for great prices as well. It’s convenient that you can type in one key word and it brings up so many things right then and there. I really love this app because it gives you great prices/deals. I recommend this to anyone, especially my fellow geeks out there. You can find so much on this app, INCLUDING AWESOME CHEAP ACTION FIGURES. I’m cosplaying as a female Vegeta in August for a convention and this app is going to come in handy for that. 

The only complaint I do have though is that when you order something, it may take a while to get to you. That’s how it’s been with all of my orders, but every time I get my order it’s accurate/high quality and totally worth the wait.

It says that things have already been delivered when they haven’t. It had been hard for me to get help from anybody. I’m just worried that I’m not going to receive these items. Is it possible for some of the stores on AliExpress to be scams. I really don’t know. I’ve been using this app since January and I just still don’t have a grip on it. It’s confusing and has me worried. 

Update: I had 2 items in dispute and one of the items just disappeared completely and I never got my refund and the seller of the other item is trying to refund me 0 dollars🤦‍♀️ so I’ve pretty much been scammed out of 30 dollars. And I still have things on the way so who knows if I’ll actually get them. I just seriously don’t want to be scammed out of more money. No big deal I guess. But I don’t recommend this to anybody it’s to buggy and weird. Obviously not garnered safety on your purchases.",2020-05-21 19:01:24,ay3jai
82,Bad site,False,1,Shopping cart doesn’t work good. Lots of sellers know how to cheat the system. You can order 3 pairs of boots but seller will only send 2 pairs and mark that they send 3 pairs when they didn’t. AliExpress does nothing to help customers and their stupid live chat doesn’t even work I can never get in contact with a real live agent always the stupid Eva computer generated answers that do me no good. They ask me to send the receipt of me paying the shipping to prove that I only received 2 pairs of boots and I asked them how the hell am I supposed to have the receipt when the seller is the one who paid for the shipping?! It also isn’t fair that they send me the wrong item and want to force me to pay to return the goods when it isn’t my fault the seller sent me the wrong item. The seller should be the one to pay for the shipping! I’m not going to pay $50 in shipping to China for an item that only cost $10 that’s just freaking stupid!!!! Don’t go to shop at this site because they will cheat you out of your money!! Also they tried to charge me for some purchases that weren’t made by me but luckily my bank called and blocked those fraudulent purchases in time.,2019-12-17 02:35:42,God hv
83,LOVE,False,5,"I was extremely skeptical about this site. You see so many like Wish, etc. AliExpress has done nothing but shocked me with quality products at a great price. 
That’s what’s wrong with this world, well one thing that’s wrong is they charge to much for crap that cost less than .50 to make. But not China or AliExpress you guys know how to make & sell. Not rob while selling & making. I appreciate your outstanding business. Love my products I get and I’ve ordered off here for going on 2 years, this December. Yes, you need to be diligent and order stuff at least 3-4 weeks in advance, and yes you need to be PATIENT. If you can handle that you’ll be just as happy as I am. Seriously, all products are made the same flipping way. US just like to make a HUGE PROFIT, while leaving the working man poor. Order something, you can afford it trust me. Then you’ll see for yourself. I’ve ordered everything from jewelry to under garments. All came PERFECT!",2019-08-29 13:10:20,MallorieO27
84,I have loved shopping at AliExpress for many years but now I keep encountering a shipping problem,False,3,I order regularly from AliExpress and now MANY items are not delivered . It is very difficult to continually keep track of all my purchases . They DO REFUND ME when I catch it within the time . But it’s VERY UPSETTING to have to continually check on the items and then have them not come and have to open a dispute I never had to do this before with AliExpress and I’m really disappointed. 99% of the time over many years the quality of the goods I have received has been excellent and I don’t mind if I have to wait to receive them but I don’t want to have to worry about the guarantee time and then not have them come in this keeps happening to me I don’t know what has changed with the shipping company because it is NO THE SELLER’S . It is the shipper . They keep changing my address on the package and when I go to tracking my address has been changed by the shipping co. The SELLER HAD SENT TO MY CORRECT ADDRESS .,2021-09-25 21:48:16,JanieNS
85,Are you skeptical?,False,5,"I like this app a lot, not only is it cheap but it’s also very friendly with small businesses and I really like that. But the shipping isn’t that fast but it’s not supper slow. Also I like that your able to comunícate with the seller directly to solve problems or ask questions. Not that I’ve had any problems myself but it’s a really grate feature to have. Honestly I was kind of skeptical about this app but now that I actually ordered things and they actually got delivered I feel very happy that I have this app because it saves you a lot of money! Also small tip always look at the reviews and check that everything is in good quality because I have a friend that always gets click baited into buying things that end up not looking the way they looked on the sellers page:) 
But overall my experience with this app is overall good.",2021-06-18 00:32:34,Seciel Contreras
86,Could be great,False,2,"I like the overall layout and flow of the app as well as the method of communication. I do not like receiving so many ads from sellers and I wish that I could just turn that feature off period. I also am not a big fan of the primary suggestion algorithm. If I look at something, it floods my screen with other versions of that thing. What happens if I click on something because I’m curious to even know what it is?  Now my screen fills with junk that I’ve no interest in. What if the description isn’t clear until I click on the item?  Looking for men’s running shorts but a pair of women’s shorts come up and I click on it to find that they are women’s shorts…. Now my screen is flooded with women’s running shorts. If I specify that I don’t like that pair of women’s running shorts, it still shows me more and then expands to women’s socks, bras, etc. I end up with many things that I’ve no interest in before me. Not a good sales strategy because it forces me to specify what I want instead of discovering which is the point of the algorithm to begin with.",2021-12-02 18:47:50,You could do better
87,5 Stars!!!,False,5,"I have made more purchases than I care to count (I’m a little obsessed with this app). I was hesitant at first, and kind of tested the waters, but once I found out how reliable the products were and that they reliably came in approx 2-4 weeks, I started buying more and more.  I’m hooked.  I have received everything I have ordered, and the longest I had to wait for a product was 6 weeks.  All products come with tracking.  I have only gotten a couple of defective products and the one product was re-sent and worked fine, and the second was also re-sent but it was defective, so the seller refunded my money.  Both were very friendly exchanges between myself & seller, so it was not a bad experience.  My best advice is to read the reviews and look at the buyer submitted pictures prior to purchase, and everything should go smooth.  I can say I really don’t mind the ship time, considering how much money I save!",2018-08-30 18:48:33,Redviolet_0
88,"Great tool, but be smart",False,5,"The best thing aliexpress has going for it, is that it’s cheap. Almost everything on this app is cheaper than equivalent items elsewhere. 

For example, I saw a really cool acrylic periodic table with samples of all of the non-radioactive elements included, being advertised by some ad on tiktok. They were charging like $70. I thought to myself, “I bet they drop-shipped that. I bet they’re getting this exact item cheaper from another source and just reselling it as a ‘premium’ item for more money.” I was right. Went on aliexpress and looked up acrylic periodic tables and they're like $25 for nice ones. 

But cheaper isn’t always better. Cheap knockoffs of electronics will have longevity issues. Batteries can be dangerous if they’re counterfeit. Some sellers are scammers, but aliexpress has pretty good buyer protections. 

My only complaint is the waiting! I understand it takes a while to ship goods directly from the manufacturer, but I bought a beautiful phone case for $5 shipped and I had to wait two weeks for it. Not aliexpress’s fault that China is far away. 

I would personally use Apple Pay to purchase goods though. Out of all the companies that have my payment info on file, apple is one of few that haven’t accidentally leaked my credit card info yet. I’m not sure I have that same trust for aliexpress.",2022-08-14 02:05:23,yerdie

Overall I have been very pleased with my purchases synthetic wig, full & front lace human, jewelry, children hair bows and children clothing extremely happy. When ordering Womens clothing just be careful because the styles are more European cut...good to order up a size... and follow the sizing chart. I do recommend reading the reviews of an item with different merchants that sells the item ...make sure you search the item of interest in AliExpress full site (not just that store)... often you’ll found the item cheaper with other merchants (price compare)... also reach out to merchants and haggle price (you can get lucky) Most merchants do effectively communicate to my you happy Had a few bad experiences...of course I gave them poor reviews.... Overall highly recommend anyone purchasing through the site",2022-04-22 09:40:43,anangelwms
90,Long time buyer,False,4,"I e found some great bargains and have been happy. Shipping takes longer, and a couple of items never got here. What I’ve noticed is the prices are increasing so I really look at prices vs time to receive before making a decision. Good app but like all shopping apps you have to be aware Still can’t beat Ali Express I love this app but I wish prices would quit raising Satisfied with app. Prices are still rising. I started using the app because you could order the same stuff for less than on other apps Nothing to add Still using the app but more careful about what and who I buy from Prices are going up. Kind of adds to the waiting for shipping. Will be very picky about what I order. And if you order on items available in the US the shipping cost increases a lot
My opinion remains the same. It used to be worth the wait to receive items but I can find most items in the US for the same price",2022-06-29 14:55:59,KimE1023
91,Sellers should be more responsible,False,5,"I mean, they put something up just to refuse a buyer from buying it. Without any details of their doings on their listing. It felt like a parade handshake refusal. I found out about their selling issue when I sent a message about the whacky address and wrong letter in my name. Address didn’t have uniform capitalization. Wrong wrong. Twice two lines. So what happened is that this item was probably reserved for someone. If only policy would tell, Ali must inform seller to add details about this reservation. But what it says is that buyer can lose their privileges if they are false reporting? Hard to know where I am at. But they were truly dishonest with the listing, in terms of selling. My ground would with them: telling the problem( the parade refusal) and telling me to cancel. Which I did. So I made the automatic agreement to no longer do business.",2022-09-03 22:15:46,saprra
92,my opinion on Aliexpress,False,4,This app would be absolutely perfect if it wasn’t for the filtering process of some of the lousy people you have selling products. There are some companies I will take your money either a steal it from you entirely or b take forever to get your product and rip you off a little bit in the process. I mean I spent $40 for shipping one time and it still took two months to get to me it was ridiculous that has to be a better justice process when dealing with lousy people like that. i’m an honest man and I’ve spent thousands of dollars on AliExpress and recently I’ve been very discouraged with what I’ve come to find is the end result of shady business people not getting in trouble they shouldn’t just get kicked off or get a warning they should literally be removed from the site entirely I’m very upset about this how much I want to lower the rating down to a three because of it but I won’t not today.,2021-08-15 05:31:13,Aleister Cumly V
93,Product quality is hit and miss- delivery time is a joke,False,2,"Products sold on AliExpress appear amazing in their videos, but reality is often a different story.   I’ve ordered many, many products  from AliExpress and many times the item is broken right from the start, or malfunctions within a week making it virtually useless, which is super disappointing and frustrating.   Some of the items I’ve gotten from AliExpress end up working as described which is great when it does.   The risk is in not being able to predict which products will deliver and which will flop.    

Nearly all of products sold on AliExpress are made and shipped from China so delivery time is suuuuuupper sloooooow, like worse than snail slow.   I’m going on seven weeks waiting for purchases I made on AliExpress back in March, and they still show as “waiting for dispatch”, which means they haven’t even left their country yet.  

Just keep these things in mind when ordering from AliExpress:   Products are sold at very attractive prices, but you get what you pay for.   Receiving your items take foooorever.",2020-04-26 18:37:11,Jesse M. Lopez
94,#TRUTH,False,4,"I’m totally addicted to the website and am willing to take my chance on getting a few poopoo items bc of the prices. Delayed shipping is to just be expected. Just get familiar with searching reviews, looking at photos and even comparing similar for better packages for the price. For some reason I’m hooked on trying to get extra points ( coins) with all the little quick games and task even though you never really win what they say. I’ve almost proven that any of their task involving recommending a friend never gives the gifts they say they will and also, I’m coming to find that the “freebies” you can pick twice a day may not be legit either because so far I’ve talked to a few of the stores owners and they have no idea what I’m talking about. I guess I have that one little hope left that I can win a freebie even if it’s wort 25cents. It would so just tickle my pickle for all my hard work and money spent on this site!",2021-01-27 03:23:33,SarahAnd Sarah
95,BE CAREFUL. BUYER PROTECTION IS BAD,False,1,First let me start by saying that I love AliExpress and I have purchased hundreds of dollars worth of stuff from this site. But it wasn’t until recently that I had an issue with an item. And this is the main and only gripe that I have with the site/app. A seller sent me an item that wasn’t as described I messaged the seller and told him that the item wasn’t as it was pictures in the listing. He said it was the same. So I opened a dispute and I uploaded evidence. AliExpress rejected my dispute. I uploaded more pictures and they said they would give me a partial refund I stated I had no use for the item. They wanted to give me $3.57 on an item that cost $19 because they deemed it had value it was just defective. I even offered to return the item if the buyer paid shipping they stated I would have to pay shipping.  But as a customer I didn’t ask for a defective inaccurate item. Why should we as customers get penalized for defective items. As much as I love this site their bad buyer protection really tuned me off and I will no longer order from this site out of fear of getting a defective item. And not be able to get a refund .,2020-10-25 07:01:21,jdhey36yfhfbbfhd
96,unexpectedly good service and quality,False,5,"aliexpress has really come a long way from the shady place I used to go for knock-off jerseys and stuff like that. I make sure the items Im buying are backed by their purchase protection, which is a feature that isnt just an empty promise to bring business. I rarely have any problems, but if I do, they have refunded me without having to jump through hoops or deal with some drawn out process. definitely still use caution and try and stick with reputable sellers, but if you have the time to wait for international shipping, its worth giving aliexpress a shot.

I like to tinker with microcontrollers like Arduino products, and Aliexpress has everything I could want in that market, such as sensors, LEDs, etc. They also had items I couldnt find anywhere else for building SFF computers, such as modular flex-atx power supplies and cpu coolers under 40mm",2021-10-16 03:32:35,tickly tips
97,I love !,False,5,"I’ve been an AliExpress memeber for over two years now . I’m a silver memember and I’m almost to their highest level . AliExpress I’d never hit or miss. The quality is what you pay for . To avoid catfish products I only buy those with reviews .. that way I can see the actual product clients receive . I’ve found many great brands on AliExpress like Wekeep and Julia Kiss both whom make great quality clothing . I’ve found amazing lashes for a fraction of the price. My led light strips which I’ve had for over two years still work perfectly fine . Most of my items have been great quality and whenever a part is missing the sellers are always willing to replace it no problem . Sometimes when I order jewlery or shirts , the seller will give me a free present free . Sometimes packages come with little bracelets and such for free ! Absolutely love this app ! Also all these Instagram accounts get their clothes from here 🥴🥴🥴",2019-03-27 11:14:23,Bryawnis
98,Buyer beware!!,False,1,"Can you find items cheaper on AliExpress? Usually, yes. HOWEVER, be aware that there is absolutely NO customer service... as in, there is no human to take care of you if an order goes wrong. You can submit a dispute- but that is actually a joke, and gets you nowhere- only harming the usually innocent shop owner, while Ali reaps the benefits. You rarely see your money again- if you’re lucky you might deal directly with the shop owner, and if they are willing to work with you they might send you a replacement product... but in my case, when there was a language breakdown - and Ali began giving multiple shops the wrong address for me (even tho the correct one was clearly stated in my account) I never received ANY of my orders, as they were returned to sender directly from the post office before I was ever notified of their arrival there. The disputes were mostly deemed invalid somehow, and I had no way of fighting this because there was no human to speak to and I lost my money. A lot of it. So, lesson learned... this was a great, cheaper alternative to finding so many items... until it wasn’t.",2021-06-18 02:47:20,Not happy >:/ !!!

Furthermore they have freebies that you can apply each day. I have won 2 so far. When you see those adds on Instagram or Facebook selling clothes or something else, always check first if they sell on Ali. They usually do.
Before buying a product on Ali check for reviews or sellers rating. Also check for the same item on other stores, take screen shot and search item by image, I usually refine by orders but you can also do with free shipping etc. Also check promo codes in same store to use in your buy. Check every day for coins, coins will give you discounts. There’s also the 3 items for $6 or $9.99 and even 7 days shipping. There’s really cute stores that have really good quality with price.",2022-11-23 19:26:55,Vcdst

If you can handle the shipping time. Skip the middle man and go straight to the source! I have been ordering for a couple years and have only been disappointed twice which I have to say is a remarkable considering I have ordered hundreds of items. Pay attention to product and seller ratings, read descriptions, and take time before ordering to make sure you are ordering the correct product and you will have great results. I also tend to leave honest and real reviews.. the good the bad and the not so good.. one thing I can say is that the manufacturers in China have raised their prices sometimes by 200% as well as charging for shipping.. I see now why the prices in the US have skyrocketed.",2022-11-03 21:37:57,Tonisstuff

First of all these people uses Americans, And the customer service is totally robots. And there communication is with bots no humans at all, they say the same thing at different times. They act like they so slow but they no the are SCAMMERS that take money from people when the asking for a refund, I give all information about the shipping that I have they tell me I am lie when all we discussed. Then they say I can’t get my money back!!! Don’t shop here unless u want auto still from you. They even made another account in my name and the even be using it.

I am a diamond member which is the highest level so I’m very familiar with how they work. I’ve gotten some amazing products from here, I’ve gotten some absolute junk and I’ve not received products. It’s very important to read details very carefully. Keep your body measurements handy because an Asian L can be an American XS but in the description it clearly state actual measurements to avoid this issue. Read review well and look at product description photos because they will show a beautiful photo to catch your eye then when you look at the actual photo of product it’s not as nice. If you don’t receive your products create a dispute and they are really good at getting you your refund. I’ve learned to find great retailers with great review and quality products and stick to shopping with them. Usually if someone has no reviews I’d stay away from them.",2020-02-20 23:01:41,Kina Harris
103,My experience and opinion,False,5,The shipping could be a little more reasonable on some item they are very high I even had paid some that were higher than the product I bought.  Been ordering off this site now for over 2 years and only had the shipping issue in the last year.  The shipping time to get to the United States now take way longer than the normal time I am still waiting on orders that were ordered back in January of 2021.  Not only that I had to open 2 disputes already and they get marked as delivered when the product never got delivered so it would make sense if a shipper does not ship then when the dispute is open it should not be marked as received especially when it never left your country.

This issue happened back in July!! She insisted it was Fed ex fault! After we both contacted our cal fed ex to put in a claim! For an refund Fed ex informed me that they only issue the refund to the shipper (which in this case is the vendor off Ali express) August 4 Fed ex informed me that they sent the check to Recool Distribution Vendor Clare Li! She seemed as though she was kind at first and trying to help on up until she received the refund! Once she got it she blocked me from messaging her and commenting on anything on their page! I assume this was a great company and vendor because of all the good feedback when really she blocks the people after she steal your money!! I contacted Ali Express several times and here it is October and no one has helped! I’ve been a very faithful customer of Ali express but they are More their customers! I am not blocked from Recool Distribution and they stole 500$ from my credit card as well as the 500$ Fed ex refunded back! ALI EXPRESS ALLOWS SCAMMERS TO sell MERCHANDISE ON THEIR APP!

105,"If you want to blow money, but not a lot of money...",False,5,"This is the app. You get good products for prices significantly lower than mainstream producers, and the items are typically of better quality than that of Wish. This app allows you to open disputes for items that have issues, whether be shipping, quality, or refunds, and it allows communication between the sellers and other buyers to get a better idea of the product. There are some bootleggers but if you pay attention, they are very easy to avoid, and there aren’t many. The app itself is legit, even if some of the sellers are not. The business behind the app also has a seller-accountability system that works to keep the sellers accountable (given the name, haha). I overall recommended the app. To give you an idea of pricing, I once bought two hoodies and a shirt, all of good quality, under $25 total. I am pretty happy with this app. :)",2019-06-25 23:07:16,S.Harp #
106,Order sorting could be better,False,4,"I love this app. I’ve purchased inexpensive craft supplies that I’ve never seen anywhere else. I’ve purchased shoes that were inexpensive, but great quality!! So is the jewelry I’ve ordered. By the price, you’d think it would be junkie feeling, but it’s great! I’ve gotten all of my orders, even during the pandemic. They have great order protection. The sellers are really easy to work with. Also, the freebies!!! They are legit! I’ve been ordering with AlliExpress since Jan2020, and have won 3 freebies in 5 months. They work like a raffle or lottery drawing. Each day you can sign up for 2 items on their list, within 4-5 days, they post who wins the drawings. My only wish for the app would be to be able easily filter to the orders I haven’t received, and sort by order date. Maybe that’s already available, but I haven’t figured out how to do it. I highly recommend it this app!",2022-02-12 21:14:59,AnnyRie
107,Some fixes please,False,3,"I’ve been an AliExpress customer for a few years. I stopped using it after a nasty dispute with a seller over something I purchased and decided to give it another shot. Some time in late May, I purchased a cosplay prop and never received it. The tracking showed that it was processed in Chicago on June 13th but nothing ever came of it. I opened a dispute and AliExpress immediately sided with the seller because of the tracking information. As of July 7th, 2019 I still have not received the prop. If a product is lost in transit l, it’s lost and not coming. It’s unfair for the seller to be using that to their advantage. The same thing ended up happening with three other items I purchased. A pair of gauges, a masquerade mask, and a laptop dust cover. 

AliExpress also needs to be stricter on what images can be posted for reviews. I’ve seen some explicit photos that people posted on AliExpress reviews for stuff meant for adults. I’m not going to go into detail of what these photos are you should get the gist of what I’m saying.",2019-07-07 18:40:59,Mara_Lilim
108,Outstanding! Everything I Want Is Here!,False,5,"I like AliExpress very much. As a model maker I’ve been able to find tools, adhesives, paints, electronic components & other items that I haven’t been able to find anywhere else. I’ve also purchased gifts, automotive items & household items on AliExpress. Everything I’ve purchased has been of excellent quality & offered at very reasonable prices. Nearly everything I’ve ordered has been shipped to me for free, too. I find that sometimes it takes quite a while to receive my orders, but that’s made apparent up front with estimated delivery dates shown for each item when I check out. As long as I anticipate my needs early & get my orders placed as soon as possible, everything works out fine. 

I highly recommend AliExpress to everyone. I’m confident that anyone who gives them a try will find the variety of merchandise & low prices astounding.",2018-12-30 10:31:00,Pittsfield Pete
109,It’s Improved,False,5,"The site’s overall layout and mechanics is fair. It feels a little busy, claustrophobic and overwhelming. Once you take the cart to the checkout, it seems to get a bit smoother and feels more comfortable to finish the process. The email updates are a nice communication piece, as it’s always a good thing to know the status of the package as it leaves China’s border, enters customs of yours, is delayed, is out for delivery, and so on. So far I’ve had 3 refunds go rather smoothly: one seller wanted more money than what the item I bought was listed (I declined the purchase); another piece was delivered crumbling, dry, and unusable, and a third just never arrived; it just sat in US customs for 2 months and never moved. Ali will refund the buyer if the package is lost after 75 days (I think), and that’s what happened for me. It was fairly painless. I’ll keep shopping here.",2021-09-25 02:30:19,ColdGlitch
110,"Honest review of AliExpress from my perspective,",False,3,"I’ve been using AliExpress for awhile now. It’s actually really good and there are plenty of wonderful items curated by the massive array of stores on there. I haven’t had a bad experience quite yet, though I’ve felt minor disappointment with only a handful of orders thus far. I’m giving this 3 stars because of the coins, and how I’m hardly able to use them for the most part. I just wish we could choose how many of them we’d like to use for our orders, rather than only having maybe a dollar off on a huge order. It’s better than nothing, but it hardly makes a difference and I have so many coins stacked up already. Apps like SHEIN are fantastic with their system of points, which take off however much you want from your purchase. 
The only thing I’d truly want to change about this app is how we can utilize our coins, but otherwise, it’s typically pleasant, fun to browse and functional.",2022-10-20 18:20:25,Derpggfffr

The coin system for discounts is not so clear. There should be a category specific for stores that accept coins as payment, since now I can only find that out at check out or by simulating a purchase. And as a Platinum, I don’t understand what the 10% discount means, as I never seem to get that much off my purchases...Where is the 10% off? :))
As for EVA, I wish there were an e-mail we could send in case our problem doesn’t get solved or our question is not included in the system. 
I’ like to suggest stores set up a warehouse in Brazil, just like what they do in other countries, with their top selling products, so we could get their products faster. 
Other than that, It’s great to shop through the app.",2021-03-09 16:29:38,DaniTrad14
113,Several fixes needed,False,2,"While I appreciate the fact that I can get several items significantly cheaper on this site than I would be able to elsewhere, two really big things bother me.
For starters, the app randomly deletes messages between yourself and sellers. Unfortunately you have to screenshot the conversations almost immediately in case you need them for dispute evidence later on which can be very frustrating.
Furthermore, I don't like that you aren't able to dispute an order once you've confirmed the goods received. It isn't uncommon for sellers to mess up orders and request that you confirm the goods and leave them positive feedback before they remedy the issue. These sellers back you into a corner and Aliexpress assists them. While you COULD refuse and simply dispute it, often times you'll have to pay some sort of return shipping which can be quite costly depending on what country you're in. It is typically easier to just bite the bullet and work with the company even if it means giving a dishonest review and misleading potential customers.",2019-09-11 07:46:31,DaJanaeMo😊
114,Scammers,False,1,I have purchased a number of shoes form a seller Jordan’s 11 xl and the product I received is fake the carbon fiber is plastic. I sent the seller a number of pictures form the authentic shoes compared to what I received and the seller continued to state there real. So I open a dispute  and told by Ali express my evidence is not real they won’t accept it but yet they allow the seller to use one of the pictures I sent them as proof against me lol what a joke. I also added pictures form the sellers listing and the shoes they sent me wich are clearly different and told the same thing . They are now trying to tell me the seller has provided invoice proof but I have not seen this so called invoice proof at all. And like previous stated many times form other users the customer service chat is a joke as they just repeat not sense and cannot answer simple questions. My advice don’t purchase shoes form Ali express or any other items and contact your bank or card customer service for fraud protection but chance of getting your money back sense Ali express money back guarantee is a complete joke as they always seem to decide with the seller.,2019-02-19 21:06:34,noshoesformAli
115,Great place & a Great Price,False,5,"This place has so many cool things to find! Also has Great Price’s! I was skeptic at first by a couple of negative reviews, but I gave it a chance & I’ve ordered close to 70 items and ALL GOOD!!! Not one problem at all! I know some people trip on the shipping, and it does take about 30 days & that’s pretty good going thru Customs and all that. I’ve had some things take less then 2 weeks, & a couple of things took almost 40 days, but with prices this good, I can wait.  When you do order something, they give you a estimated date for it to arrive & it’s always Way WAY before that date! 
I’ve also found so many things I didn’t even know were made & have had fun trying these things out! They also have games you can play to get discounts! No joke! Try it out! It’s a great place to shop!!!",2022-03-04 09:59:22,Jaemmen99
116,Fun App,False,5,"Enjoy the shopping. Amazing light fixtures... state of the art, really. Just dig deep and enjoy spending hours looking through all the amazing offerings. 
 I always have 100 items in my cart... maxed out and unable to add more until I delete. Haha.  I’ve only ordered a dozen small items, so am learning to watch for shipping costs better. Also, one seller put my shipping info in backwards which sent my package clear across town. Luckily, a friend of mine owns the business, so he sent me a text today w a picture of my package. How random, eh?
Not sure how to navigate those waters with potential sellers/purchases in the future, but, I’ll take my chances. My fav purchase so far has been a deep lavender rechargeable flashlight for under $10. The seller sent me a bonus black flashlight w my order. Wayyyyy brighter, lighter and smaller than my lame $$$ MagLights!",2021-05-08 18:27:49,MimosaLove
117,great platform.  some suggestion to consider,False,5,"AliExpress has an extensive portfolio of products, at very reasonable prices!  promotions and a great experience.  the only thing that AliExpress should improve is to follow up on some sellers who list items with deception.  an example of them is a pair of shoes at $ 8 when you go to see the product you see that $ 8 cost a few brushes to clean shoes and the cost of the shoes that show you are $ 25 that is misleading advertising, another bad practice offer  shipments from the United States with shipping characteristics of 5 to 8 days etc. you select that the shipment is from the United States and you pay for receiving the item in that amount of days and the seller passes it from China and it takes 2 to 3 weeks in  arrive!  those practices are those that I consider AliExpress must improve to not generate repudiation of customers!  of rest the platform is great ..!",2019-06-20 23:50:52,Corpco
118,"Good app, needs several improvements",False,4,"The orders should be searchable by tracking number, and the 15 day option for filing a dispute should be marked as a timer on the order itself, so the seller AND buyer can see it. Crafts needs to be separated into several categories all by themselves. Items already shipped should be sorted by oldest shipped showing up first. The stores you’re following should be able to be sorted alphabetically. The wish list should be expanded to 15 or 20 categories/subjects! Way too few list options! And when you look at your list of shipped items, it stops halfway through to “upload” the next half of the list, it sends you back to almost the start of the list! I hate that part. The tracking should NOT say “Completed” just because Purchase Protection expires on the order. The tracking system needs a MAJOR overhaul and upgrade.",2022-08-19 00:35:26,Stalaro9
119,A different way of doing business,False,1,"I ordered a yhree things in the last year from Alliexpress. There were problems with each order. In all cases, the vendor sent me something different from what I ordered. In two of the cases, they sent something drastically different from what was pictured and describes. Their resolution was to give me a partial refund to keep the product I didn’t order and don’t want, or pay return shipping to China myself and get a full refund. The shipping charges to return were more than the product price, so not worth sending back unless I wanted to lose money and waste time. On the third order, they sent a sent shocks for my RC truck. Three front shocks and one rear shock. I asked them to send a second rear shock, and they refused. They did offer a partial refund for the set of shocks that was unusable. Also offered a full refund if I would pay to ship them. Ask to China. Alliexpress agreed with the partial refund proposals offered. China thinks differently from Americans, so you’re Linley to run into similar issues if you order from this company.",2021-07-31 14:29:53,Bunjamin1
120,My Go-To for Unique Cheap Items,False,5,"This is a great market place for ppl who know they need a specific item and can bargain shop. additionally,  this app is super easy to use and navigate even if you are just windows shopping. I’ve been using this app for over 5 years And the deals can’t be compared. I will warn you, you must shop here when looking for things you do not need right away. The shipping time is longer because items are coming from other countries. You have to plan to shop at least two to three months ahead of time to be prepared for late arrivals. Other items may come within seven days, but it is worth the wait. 

There has only been 6-8 items that I ordered, that were either worthless, didn’t work, or different from what I ordered. But again, I’ve been using this app for along time and I know the risks of online shopping.",2020-07-30 21:12:33,destinyIS
121,So many scams!,False,1,"I used to support this app wholeheartedly. Truly having great experiences when using ones head prior to purchase. However recently a lot of vendors have infiltrated this app and aliexpress seems to willfully turn a blind eye and refuses to accept factual proof pointing to scamming and dirty vendors. If a vendor contacts you after you have purchased something and they accepted your order to give them more money for shipping or bs covid claims, DO NOT DO IT!!! IT IS A SCAM!!! These practices are 100% illegal. Report them immediately to Aliexpress as well to anywhere else that has aliexpress communities (ie reddit fb etc) . I once believed AliExpress had our best interest at heart but after my several reports of illegal and fraudulent vendor behaviors ignored i just dont know how much longer i feel comfortable backing this marketplace. It’s sad, but we have to watch out for our fellow consumers. Dont give into scams,it hurts us all! I would say sorry AliExpress but youve decided to put me in a corner i tried very hard to make you aware of. I trusted you, now im paying the consequences and you STILL refuse to listen.",2020-09-25 01:04:24,ccschaeffer84
122,A great dollar store online,False,5,"I love AliExpress, I’ve been using it for about a year now and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve purchased a whole bunch of useless things off of this website. The reviews actually help because you get to see a lot of pictures and they’re all very believable. Sometimes you get what you pay for other times you discover gems where you never expected to find. I love how cheap you can find things for. The ONLY downside is how long you have to wait for products to come in, but at least for me they have always come except for two times and they were both products for like 80 cents. So it’s never really that big of a loss. I wouldn’t buy anything too too expensive though, just to be on the safe side, but I’ve always gotten a refund so that’s also a good thing. If you love cute and cheap things AliExpress is the place!!!",2019-07-27 07:01:35,KawaiiT1
123,I buy way more then I should!,False,4,"You could say I’m a pro AliExpress shopper. I absolutely love how I can get things for my home or for myself for cheap. I live in Alaska and it’s expensive here for cheap stuff. I buy all my bras and underwear for super cheap on this site and the quality is astounding! You just have to remember to size up! I also buy other things like makeup, kitchen utensil, door handles and more! I do love about 3 brands of makeup offered on this site. Sure I wouldn’t trust all of them but the majority of them have an ingredient list. It takes a while but I can wait for a good price. The one take away I absolutely hate in the search engine. Sometimes it’s hard to find goodies and you have to have a good word to search. I can’t seem to get my mother-in-law hooked because she just doesn’t understand how.

124,I shop here all the time,False,5,"I shop on this site very frequently.  Products are cheap.  There are many sellers that sell the same product.  They can be found and compared via keywords or using the image search.  
My tips when shopping here:
Prioritize sellers that post actual photos of the product (as opposed to heavily photoshopped model photos) or have both photos of model and the actual product itself.  Also reliable are customer review photos.  Even if the seller only posted model photos or limited info about the product, if it has many reviews and reviewers had uploaded photos I base my decision to order on those images.

Even if you did your due diligence and ordered but the product you receive is grossly different from the seller’s description or photos, as long as you have good reason to file a dispute AliExpress will refund you the money.  

It is not the website to go to if you are in a rush. Lately shipping to Japan seem to have gotten quicker, but it’s still international shipping so there is a wait.  But as long as you don’t mind waiting, I think it is a cheap, reliable site/app to shop from.

I noticed that AliExpress started free return shipping for some countries.  Now, if that would cover Japan too, it would be excellent.",2021-12-25 09:05:59,Chanbot11

At first I was very reserved about placing any order from the website, but after seeing the way they are in the whole process of the transaction from the initial order to making sure you are happy with your purchase I have never second guessed or questioned purchase from any shops.

128,The one area I would appreciate a change,False,4,"I purchase quite a few items on this website to help with my crafts. So it is in my best interest to keep track of the items I’ve purchased and learn exactly where they are in the shipping process. Which leads me to where I would greatly appreciate a change. Please let me try to explain. 

The one place where I would greatly appreciate a change would be right after I click ‘Confirm Goods Received’,and be able to go directly back to the exact same place of where I had been before I had clicked on, Confirm Goods Received’.  

Unfortunately, I am sent right back to the top of the page of items shipped, rather than directly to the place I had been before hitting the Confirms button. This leads me to having to scroll all the way back to where I had been before, which can be quite a number of pages down. 

It is so frustrating having to scroll three, four, and even five pages before I can get back to the exact place I had left. I would love to have the ability to go directly back to my spot, so I can continue with following where my items are in the mail or clicking the confirm button. It would definitely save me a lot of time, and it would encourage me to use this part of the app more frequently, along with me giving my feedback to more of the stores. 
Thank you for your time.",2020-12-02 08:02:38,Ma'iingankwe
129,I have mixed feelings,False,3,"I raised my ratings because customer service has been great so far. It’s just a little hard getting through a live person. 

If item is damaged it’s hard to get a refund with picture. If seller is nice they will give a partial refund even if you are not planning to use the damaged item. I guess it’s better then nothing. 

Sometimes seller marks it as shipped then for some reason when you check your tracking it shows as cancelled. If item was cancelled for no reason all you have to do is take a snap shot of cancelled screen as proof and dispute it or contact a live customer representative to get a refund. 

Another thing is while some sellers are nice and honest, there are a few that are questionable. I’m not sure if it’s because they do not understand English. I was told they would get back to me about why my order was cancelled but they never got back to me. Thankfully customer service helped me with my refund. I gave it 3 stars because of customer service and a few sellers. Other then that I would rate it 1 star. 

Also it takes long for most sellers to ship out your item. If you don’t mind 1-2 months of waiting and praying you will get your item then this is for you. But there are a few sellers (very few that I came across) that ship really fast. I’m not sure it’s worth the wait and stress hoping that your item will actually arrive.",2020-11-28 06:23:24,Funfacegirl
130,Not for idiots,False,5,"People that are complaining and are quick to judge and assume that aliexpress is a scam well you missed a lot of things to research. Before buying here use your brains.
Here’s some tips:

 1. Look at the reviews of the product if someone has pictures and bought it. 

2. Dont send most of your complaints to the sellers! Go to the customer support and simply type “i need a human” for a live agent. Because sellers will not talk much or is able to help with the problem once they shipped it!

3. Look at the store ratings. 90% is alright but the higher the better! 

4. In disputes it is said that you have to upload an evidence. Read and check your emails to get the full information! Most evidences are usually from your post office!

5. Find other online trackers because the one in aliexpress is bugged/confusing.

6. Try searching your problems on google first whether or not you can trust aliexpress and read some experiences from other buyers! 

7. Dont always complain why its not coming blah blah do your part and follow it up! Because packages tend to get lost or broken. Keep reaching out to the customer support.

There you all go. 
Not sure about other people’s idiotic problems but i ordered here with 6 items and all of it was delivered to me. 

Use your brains before you speak.",2020-11-05 16:39:14,Elliemillernia
131,Love to shop !,False,5,"I love Ali Express because there is soooooo much variety that you wouldn’t normally find locally or in the US . Price is often reasonable . 
Shipping time usually is quick , with some exceptions . Sellers often will respond , although I’ve personally encountered one who didn’t respond & had to go to mitigation . I had issues also with sizes so you have to very careful when buying clothing. I was very apprehensive about ordering from China , but so far so good !
Update ... For whatever reason. , it will not always allow me to use my cards for payments. I followed the directions for appeal & it won’t even allow me to use it . Spoke with rep from my bank & there is nothing wrong .
Can’t speak with anybody from AliExpress . Used the app to communicate & they weren’t able to help me . Don’t understand the problem ! 🙁",2021-02-02 01:17:10,shopper in LV
132,It’s alright...,False,3,I got this app since Facebook would annoy the hell outta me with it. Tried it and well I did get a few things that I really enjoyed. Problem that I had were always the big items. Idk if it’s just the seller but I would never receive the bigger items I’ve purchased. Smaller stuff like cellphone case and or small stuffed animals would arrive to me no problem. But bigger items would always be the issue. I’ve always gotten my money back from the seller no problem. Also the tracking most of the seller will have for you track you package is either transit and never moves since it’s never updated or the tracking website would never load the tracking. Which makes it hard to track any item your purchased. I’ll still keep the app to buy the smaller items but more than that it kinda isn’t worth it when I sorta know I’m getting knock out items. Oh for PayPal users just know not many sellers will have the PayPal button.,2020-01-04 10:25:06,idfc apple

Download it and have a look at what kinds of things are available for very reasonable prices. I bet you’d be surprised what you can find when you go down the rabbit hole, and there are hundreds of rabbit holes to pursue with a hundred more branching off those. I found myself looking at different kinds of very large kites for under $10 one night, and then a portable tire air compressor, and then some watches, a Princess Mononoke poster, smoking pipes, a multicolor strobe light, some exercise equipment, etc... The point being, you’d be surprised what’s available from having virtually unlimited access to stores from around the world.",2020-04-29 05:15:04,Bobbert12534
134,I love this store!,False,5,I will be truthful. Many years ago when I first started shopping at AliExpress I had lower expectations of both the quality of items and the shipping speed. I haven’t shopped here for a very long time. Mostly because my children cut me off because I was spending too much money and got some low quality items. I have a project that I am working on and it would’ve cost me an arm and a leg to do it on any other websites. Of course I have found more than I needed for my project. I love the store. I do keep my purchases to very reasonable amount of money. The quality is A1 and the speed of shipping has gotten so much better. They say that it’ll be 60 days till you get your items but I’ve gotten some items in two in three weeks. Take the jump! You will be glad you did,2022-11-19 22:27:23,HappyCappy515
135,Meets every shopping need if you know what you’re doing✨,False,5,"I get everything from stickers, posters, speakers, contact paper, wholesale eyelashes for resell, and eyeliners to cosplay, wigs, hoodies, headsets, eye contacts, and custom blankets here. The 3-4 weeks shipping is so worth the extremely low prices and (in some cases- FREE) shipping cost. If you need fast shipping, some sellers have other expedited shipping methods (priced accordingly of course) such as DHL or FedEx CAUTION:
-these sellers are real people, so be sure you find the right one to provide for you. There are some who will bend over backwards for your sale, and there are others that don’t bother with communication entirely.
- I don’t recommend buying the cheap clothing here, unless you don’t care to risk item quality. It certainly will not look like the Instagram model photos they use lol. You can always ask for factory images of products.",2020-09-28 06:23:19,dustyjae
136,FRAUD,False,1,Is there a zero rating because that is what I would like to gve to this app. I order several items which i have received with no problem so i thought it was good until i did not receive one item that i ordered from Lucyever Store. The seller insisted it was delivered and it was signed for. I asked for proof seller could not provide any except for the screenshots of the order tracking. I suggested it could have been stolen since Since they normally leave it just outside or in the mailbox but they keep ignoring what i say but instead i Instructed me to go to the post office to check when I paid for shipping for them to deliver the item to me. Since they dont have a customer service toll free They only have chat support and they will ask to put you on hold while pretending to check the you get Disconnected from the chat. You get someone else again and start over your concern again. So they are really not helping and as long as they have your money they dont care. So be very careful when ordering from this app specially LUCYEVER STORE,2021-12-29 16:21:27,rissadlsrys
137,Addicted to shopping!,False,5,I have been using this app for quite some time now. I buy something every month when I get paid. Prices are good. Shipping is free to reasonable. Sizing is difficult so use the charts or contact the seller for help. I have only had a few problems and usually I was able to work them out with the seller. If not you have the option to open a dispute. You can also request an extension of their protection plan if something is taking longer than expected. That way you are safe if there is a problem. I won a dispute and got a refund. It was in my account the next day. I buy items for resale for my business and prices can’t be beat. I also buy things I want to try. Prices are so reasonable that if you don’t like an item the investment was small to find out.   Give them a try. You will be addicted too.,2020-06-18 05:52:36,papernoia

I had this problem with another store before but they gave me a refund right after I open the dispute. But this store, they sent me a bunch of emails that telling me pay more attention to the shipping status but all they gave me is “in transit” from May, and today is August. I got another email from this app that telling me “time’s up to confirm the order, but if you did not receive the package, you have 3 days to open the dispute, we’re here to help.” I opened the dispute again again and again, but they did nothing beside telling me to wait more. I tried to contact the customer service, and they did not even response to me, so i guess I lost money then. This is a fraud and also will be my last time to use this app. I rather to buy stuff on WISH because their policy is so much better to help customers when you don’t like what you bought or the package get lost.",2020-08-11 04:09:05,KrysN28
139,Know the seller and learn the app,False,5,"I keep seeing so many bad reviews that really are just people not knowing how to online shop. For those who do, it’s a great app! Obviously yes when you like something and want to buy you make sure they have sold a good amount of said item then check to see the reviews on item. If they haven’t sold much or have no reviews probably not a good seller yet. Also for people bashing the cart don’t know how to use it. You browse and can select as many items to add to cart. Then when you’re ready for checkout, you reselect the ones you for sure want and complete the order. I like that cause I sometimes click stuff I really like but find something similar cheaper and I can go back to both and see which one I really want. I really love this app so addicting and cheap! Before I never shopped online now I’m hooked!",2020-04-28 21:57:00,Maavviiaahhh27
140,Pretty great app overall,False,5,"I love this app and the ability to find good quality products for cheap.  So far, every order I’ve made has been completed, meaning that I haven’t had any problems with fraud and not receiving an item I’ve ordered.  The only problem that I can think of at the moment is that some features don’t work with cellular data, but they do with WiFi.  It’s just a small thing, but I don’t like having to turn on my WiFi just to see an item’s video and the tracking.  Other than that, I’d recommend this app and purchasing products from here.  Make sure you’re still careful though.  Do your research and pay attention to reviews, and you should be able to avoid falling for potential fraud.  You’ll be able to dispute the fraud though, so that’s great that you can get your money back when that happens.",2020-05-22 23:02:56,HfkkGreen
141,Taking money and don’t deliver,False,1,"At first they were okay, but it took 2-3 months for items to arrive, but as soon as I had problem with orders, they were not reachable, nobody got back to me, I sent pictures of the item how cheap and lousy it was, they didn’t care and just closed the case. Never got discount or money back!!! Recently even worse, they all of a sudden declare I checked that I received the item and they close the case AGAIN!!!! This is cheating and even they making excuse for the virus situation, it doesn’t mean they have to cheat!!!! They can’t say I received an item when I didn’t!!!!! I am going to report them to BBB, because it is bull! I spent a bunch of money on them and recently I didn’t receive anything!!!!

I made this comment a while back, but since then they are getting better handling things and refunding money. Still not perfect, stores still not responding many times and they still don’t refund or send new items, so it’s half and half. AliExpress needs to be more involved with the stores they handle!!!",2021-03-10 14:17:53,zazabubumimike
142,All around this site is great.,False,5,"Yes it’s a site in China but the cost savings are huge if you don’t mind waiting. There customer service is on top of it if you have a problem with your order. Be patient... you must have patience to use this site. Keep watching the tracking system to keep you updated. Some items arrive earlier. Study the photos and the description and comments from others that have purchased the same items and judge yourself if it’s really what you want or need. You can also find other sellers that sell the same item and at no shipping cost. So understand this is a site from China and they have sellers from USA,China,Russia etc. so you will have a medium to long waiting time not 2days or over night. Save huge here and you do get a response from the seller or customer service if you are disputing the item. 😊",2019-06-25 15:05:05,HawiianPunch
143,It depends on what you buy,False,3,"I guess I’m blessed to run into the “good” sellers. I’ve heard so many mixed reviews with several reviewers that I don’t know who to believe , but to say from my personal experience this app is decent. It’s not too bad nor is it great . I would usually buy clothes and tiny accessories. I bought ( shirts, eyelashes, lipsticks, fake piercings rings, headbands,etc.) I would never save my debit card on this app because of safety reasons. I would never purchase anything until I see proof of actual pictures good/bad reviews. I would always order a size up. I would ask sellers questions and ask politely the estimations of when the product has shipped. Screen shot every conversation. The shipment tracking is garbage , but at least you pay for it to come in between the shipment dates. If not on time than a day or two later. I’ve been on AliExpress since May 2019.I have not run into any bad sellers yet, but it’s best if you use the seller’s words against them for disputes and ALWAYS keep track of buyer protection. I don’t , but still .

Old Edit: I ran into a bad seller though, I won the dispute. I think I might look elsewhere for a better app with great deals other than Wish.

New edit: I wish everything was true to size. Mostly clothes are much smaller .

I also notice a lot of reviews on the app are fake. Some are genuine, but the sellers are cunning and will tell you to put five stars.",2019-10-25 04:53:15,x Ivy J x
144,App doesn’t work for Georgia,False,1,"It’s very rude, I’m logging in from Georgia (country) I had region selected as US, because I don’t ship to Georgia. First it forced me to switch to Georgia and then it didn’t let me in + everything is in Russian. We don’t speak Russian, some people does, but more people speak English than Russian and Georgia has conflict with Russia and you are forcing Russian as default language for us? I’m 100% sure it’s on purpose, because app trying so hard to change language to Russian, I’m writing email to AppStore team, I think they have to review. If you don’t have Georgian language translation, just let us choose whatever else language we need, and stop forcing Russian. I’m pretty much sure it’s not accidental but, I have reinstalled, and even tried on other platforms and it does exact same behavior, website forces Russian, app forces Russian. Uninstalling and reporting to Apple. I was using this app for years, but after this, will never pay you my money. I’ll also share in social media so other people also see and report it.",2022-11-04 22:41:18,NikaClark
145,Would give 5 stars but,False,4,"I’d give them five stars, but since they took the chance to win freebies off of their site, I hardly go on it anymore. I used to use it daily when they had the freebies, now I go on once a week to check my delivery status, and you can do that also on another app. Their delivery is slow as slow can be. If I ever had a problem I would just file a claim and get my money back. I’ve had some and they would just give the money back immediately. Their app works great, a little confusing at first but in a day or two you’ll get the hang of it. I love their policies and much easier than eBay to work with. Ebay fights you tooth and nail but AliExpress handles the problems immediately! Their prices are excellent! You could actually buy from them and resale on another site and make a nice profit. They have everything!",2022-06-06 21:22:21,FlyguyMike1
146,Maybe luck ?,False,5,"I’ve heard a few people complain that they don’t get their stuff.  Perhaps I’ve just been lucky, but apart from one parcel that I was refunded for, I’ve received everything I’ve ordered. 
Sizes of the clothing is small but “size cm/mm” are generally quoted, so check that out.  
I’m most impressed by the variety of products, from custom car parts to clothing and beauty products, the stuff is cheap, but well worth the value.  
Our local Post office charge a fee which is sometimes more then a small order from a single shop on AliExpress, so try order from the same shop, then SA PO consider it one parcel. Otherwise if you order the same items but from different shops on AliExpress they each send you parcels and SA PO charged for each individual parcel. 
So 4 items from four shops would cost just over R100 but 4 items from 1 shop R25 at SA Post Office.  
This is how it works in South Africa.  Not AliExpress’s fault.  Unless they could bundle our orders from different shops and send as 1 order.  

The points incentive scheme is silly but the “SALE’s” are excellent the items are so cheap that, that in itself is an incentive to buy.  

I suspect any problems to be local (SA) if I look at the tracking facility available on the APP, SA Customs is slow to release items.  

Love shopping on AliExpress.",2020-01-18 15:53:37,C@melt03
147,Wanna give it a 0 star,False,1,"I haven’t received my orders except one. I checked my orders yesterday and it said one of them was delivered. I checked the mail today and it’s not there. There’s no way my order was stolen and it’s too small to be left outside. I can’t even report the issues I’m having to aliexpress I have to contact the individual sellers in order to report it. The sellers weren’t helpful at all. When I do try to report the issues I’m having to aliexpress instead of the sellers, it doesn’t even work. Takes me to a bunch of other pages that don’t help at all. So I had to come here to try and report this.
 It is my first time buying from this app and I wish I never bought anything from this app. I did get one of my orders at least but it was the most recent order I ordered before my other stuff!!! 
If you’re thinking of buying from aliexpress just don’t. I mean it might be better for others but this was the worst experience I have had with buying stuff online. Buying from Wish is better than this.",2021-01-29 23:03:34,Abahell
148,Worst customer service ever!!!,False,3,"For the most part, the prices are good. You will need to be patient to receive your order, as it sometimes takes months to arrive. If all goes well with delivery, that’s a positive, but if you have an issue, forget about customer service. The initial chat is automated. If your issue fits within their list of questions, you may have a resolution. Otherwise, you will be stuck in an endless loop which demands that you pose an acceptable question. On two occasions when I was eventually able to bypass Eva, the automated chat, I was assured that my issue would be resolved, only to be ignored. Two months is too long to receive a resolution to a simple issue. If the price of the item that you ordered is not significant, it might be better to abandon any hope of a resolution, and forget about it. I’m incredulous to believe that a company as large as AliExpress would have such non-responsive customer service department.",2020-12-02 17:25:20,Franzl2019
149,Use carefully,False,1,"This app used to work just great, but there are more and more scammers on it. You buy things, wait months for them just to notice that your order was completed or delivered when in fact you’ve never received anything. You contact the seller and they never replied until your protection time runs out and cannot be refunded. On the other hand when you decide to open a dispute, AE asks you to wait 10 days and after that they will automatically refund you, but when the 10 days are up, they send the same thing and ask you to wait another 10 days. Been trying to contact the customer service for months now every single time a blank page opens up. I purchased 3 different items from 3 different stores and all 3 of them took my money, marked the transaction as completed, but never received anything. Really disappointed, used to like this app, I even recommended it to some friends, but now I’ll be telling all of them that it’s a scam. So be aware while shopping here cause AE will not help you if you have a problem.",2020-06-16 13:26:51,FGirlzzz09
150,"Love this site, for the most part",False,5,"I do a lot shopping on AliExpress. It’s got so much stuff of every variety. It’s kind of like a treasure hunt. But do keep in mind that the quality is very hit-or-miss. Also, it can take a long time to receive your items (sometimes more than 2 months). And occasionally you don’t receive your goods (though they are usually very good about giving refunds). Searching for items is fun, though frustrating if you are looking for something in particular. For example, I wear a U.S. size 12 shoe, but it’s almost impossible to find shoes this big on Ali, and I can’t search by size, so I go endlessly through the listings. Also, the site can be a mess to look through: pages don’t load correctly or go back to the beginning of a search for no treason.",2022-03-11 19:26:02,fhdudb29495
151,scammy,False,2,"I’m not really sure why the majority, whether it’s reviews on google or on the app itself, are so lenient with aliexpress. Apart from decent prices, the rest of the experience is an unorganized, scam-inducing, trashy mess. I buy expensive items on this app with good reviews, and when I never receive them, it’s impossible to rectify because I went over the imaginary timeframe to review them? This is additionally frustrating when sometimes the delivery date Extends the 15 day limit on disputes!! How am I supposed to figure out something is wrong with my item when it never shows up? (which is an expected thing for aliexpress orders to be significantly late.) And it is my sole responsibility to wager with a random business person about their product? Very aggravating, especially whilst seeing others praise this app like it has no flaws. It’s just outright unprofessionalism and aliexpress really should work to actually make the app that people adore it for. Not this wishy-washy crap.",2022-08-10 00:06:28,dawningduskk
152,Experienced online shopper,False,5,"I have been online shopping for around 8 years now. I use this app to buy cosplay and other more off the wall goods. The prices are significantly lower than comparable apps. The quality is usually slightly higher than what you would expect for the low prices. The shipping may be slower but that’s something you learn from online shopping. Order way ahead.    
   On that note I have never NOT received a item from this app. The sellers care about their score and will talk to you personally. Something most apps/sellers won’t provide. A sort of security you sometimes can’t find even on apps like Amaz°n. I also like the technical side of this app. It is programmed very well. 
  Try not to get sucked in and buy too much. It seems to happen to me a lot. 25$ elsewhere 15$ on ali, that’s 10$ more to spend!",2020-03-02 06:08:32,jo2k18

154,Awesome app,False,5,"I have been ordering from AliExpress for more than 10 years now.  Although I had a couple vendors rip me off, I was able to dispute the orders And get my money back. I highly recommend AliExpress.  The best thing is that the money is held in escrow until you verify you received your complete order.
Here are some tips:
1. I  make sure to order from vendors who have a high rating
2 I also check the number of orders the vendor had processed.
3. Once you pay for your order, keep track of the processing time And when the order was shipped.  There is a count down on the maximum number of days an order should take to get to you.   If you're clock runs out and your have not received your order, you are SOL.  If you're clock is running out and you have not received your order, you can extend the clock but you must do this before the clock completely runs out.  
4.  If  you accidently order something in your sleep (as I have done) you can cancel the order is it is still in the processing mode.  I also message the vendor along them to cancel the order and I also dispute the charge it I don't have my money back in a week.
This sounds like a daunting task but l have had some great experiences and ordered a ton of items over the years.   
Good luck.",2019-09-09 14:31:37,beenthere-donethat
155,The user experience needs improvements,False,4,"AliExpress is a good place for shopping, but  as for user experience and products shipment tracking theres alot to improve also the shipping choices as a user I don't see if it matters to me unless time and price is gonna affect. Moreover the seller direct contacting with you is not really that good neither important! The most important thing for me is to find the item is available and counted! Two items not received because there's no proper counting for products and it was finished.
Also need to make someone in middle to handle all issues and concerns for a better experience.
Anyway I'm happy with items I bought and its prices. But as I said it was frustrating to deal with dealers and the tracking is sooo slow and not accurate.
Finally the whole user experience needs re-engineering and put clear and simple indications on website and mobile app.",2019-09-09 08:09:49,BKR89
156,App suggestions,False,4,"I would like to see some changes made to Make it easier to use. 1. It would make it easier if you could go to your order history and click on multiple items at one time To delete instead of one at a time and then you have to start over again to delete the next item. I have been purchasing for many years from you and there are items I do not want to delete in case I want to reorder them but foe the ones I want to eventually delete it takes forever to do one at a time so I end up not deleting them. 2. Since I run a business and buy most all my items I sell from aliexpress, I need a bigger wish list. I have filled my wish list and my cart, trying to save items fir a later date. These two items would make buying from aliexpress much nicer and more convenient.",2022-10-28 16:55:50,cynthiaet
157,Good App,False,4,I haven’t been having problems lately with getting help after purchasing products. Two vendors did not have my items in stock after I purchased them. They would not refund my money when I asked them to and instead try to send the same items but in different colors after I had specifically told them I did not want the item unless it was in the color that I ordered. It would be great if AliExpress could be set up to notify the buyer that the item is not in stock in the color that they requested. And then have a button that indicates whether or not the buyer still wants to proceed with the sale if available in a different color and same size. This takes the option out of the sellers realm and squarely in the buyers realm where it should be if seller doesn't have the exact item in stock.,2022-08-07 02:40:27,MissyDor4
158,The platform is not safe.,False,1,"I’ve purchased a few thing here and they are ok, maybe because I’ve heard and read that the items are not as described, but I’m sure not every seller has bad intentions. So whenever I purchased I asked for videos and pictures of the actual item. If the seller doesn’t provide this; I just find an other seller. But even with this method, I made a purchase of 1,500 dollars and the sellers never sent me my item, the seller sent me something else and then closed the store. Aliexpress never responded or did anything about it. A year of me sending messages back and forth and they would do anything to avoid answering or show any sense of responsibility representing the company… The last thing from them was: A screenshot of my purchase and them telling me: Well, you purchased, so there. I responded: Well if you have this info you MUST have the info of the seller, does it show he/she sent me anything?? Aaaand again: no response from them. SO BE CAREFUL WITH ALIEXPRESS THE COMPANY ITSELF IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY. They are just “THERE”.",2022-06-18 23:05:08,Fk'sQ
159,They allow racists to market their products on this app!!!!,False,1,"I recently stumbled upon an item in AliExpress which was a shirt labeled “White Lives Matter”. Don’t get me wrong, yes all lives do matter, but we have to help everyone out when they need it. Black lives are always threatened so we need just as much help. I looked at the reviews and there was a LOT and I mean A LOT of “White Power” comments, one went as far as to say “Order everything, put these n*ggers in their place”. And the fact that they allow such things to be markedly on their app caused them to lose me as a customer. There’s a lot of scammers stealing everyone’s clothing and selling it as there own, there’s also a lot of white powder and weed like substances being sold up their as well recently. It’s just all sickening. I’m still waiting on my money back from an item I bought way LAST YEAR that never arrived to my house, but yet I can’t make a dispute because supposedly it’s in “transit” to my house. Very disappointed.

She was polite and very forthcoming to giving me my tracking number and any other info I had regarding my order.

161,Amazing App for Wholesalers / Retailers,False,5,"I have been using AliExpress for almost a year now and I’ve had no complaints.. This is definitely something to invest in if you’re trying to setup your business or even buy alternative items when you’re on a budget. Either way I’d recommend this app to anyone even if it wasn’t for the same purpose. 

It’s user-friendly and definitely a good competition if we were to compare it to other apps such as Wish. However, I’m in no means attempting to shame the other company to persuade anyone else reading this to download this app. I just have strong beliefs that I feel we should all be open-minded about when it comes to providing effective feedback for the creators. 

Yes, every application will have its flaws. However, I feel this app suits my needs the most more than another application which is why I’m recommending this. I was not paid to say any of this and I would definitely consider AliExpress in my list of useful applications.

AliExpress has done a very good job of providing everyone with an opportunity to grow businesses. Therefore, I applaud the founders and wish their tech team the best! Please keep up the great work and continue to amaze us with all you do!",2021-01-25 13:46:58,Tdawg0818

I also purchased two other items that showed up on time and we’re fine one of them was also defective and the company sent me a new one no questions asked as any good company should.. so be prepared to throw your money away if some thing isn’t satisfactory because you will not be receiving a refund..If that somehow manages to change which I highly doubt I will redo my review.",2022-06-29 01:56:25,diddledee223

I did not receive anything except for a small 4 inch bag that has garbage elastic bond! I called the USPS again to verify my package tracking number from the seller. The USPS confirmed that the small package that I received with garbage elastic bond that weigh 2 oz was the package that I was waiting for! I sent a lot of messages to the seller but the seller did not even read my messages. I reached out for a customer service rep twice. First customer rep. did not help me at all!

I just ordered a 4X jacket that arrived and fits my niece who’s 12. Not even close to Forex. But jewelry and shoes and many other things. This is your site.

So far the quality of the item is ok but I don’t expect it to be great for the price you pay them at. Still good quality. The only thing that was disappointing about this app, it does not support Apple Pay or friendly with apple payment. Since you have to verify that you are buy things from AliExpress.

I couldn’t get them to acknowledge my complaint, and the link they gave me to see the seller’s response didn’t work but I couldn’t even tell them the link didn’t work. I did get my items after another month from when I lodged the complaint but this made it clear to me that I should never buy from this site/service again because they do not help customers.

Now I am using for my personal items and received first of several items yesterday arrived in few weeks and everything good.  I agree with other reviewers have to be careful who you buy from.  For me in the dozen other items I bought I only bought from sellers that had sold quite a number maybe a dozen or more at least.  And for those with at least some volume I only bought from those that had a four to five star rating and who had posit be written reviews with pictures.

It is one of those places you have to really read(and leave) reviews to help others out. You also have to add things to the cart and check around because same item could have 10 different prices on here. A little frustrating but when you’re buying things like phone chargers or cute jewelry for under $3, hello it’s worth it!

174,Excellent app!,False,5,"I really enjoy browsing through the AliExpress app. It is actually more enjoyable than browsing through the desktop website if you ask me. The app is organized, and has a clean look to it. The one thing I wish the would change is how fast the product videos play. Usually I have to wait a minute or two before it starts to play. I don’t normally mind waiting but sometimes the app crashes if I have to wait for too long. Another thing that would make a better shipping experience is if there was more different kinds of products that appeared on your dash board. I usually get a lot of the same stuff from different sellers popping up, and I’d really like to see some more variety. All in all, I am very happy with this app! 🌸💕",2021-10-21 16:40:35,lumpycushy
175,NOT Trustworthy Sellers On Their App,False,1,"Soon after buying a video game console, I get a message from the seller saying they are sold out and asked me to either ask for a refund or buy a different model console. I asked for a refund. In order to do a refund I had to go cancel my order. I selected cancel order>select reason why> seller doesn’t have it. When I did this I get a message from the seller asking me to change my reason for cancelation or I won’t get my refund. I think the seller deserves a bad rating because they strong armed me into canceling it because >buyer doesn’t want it anymore. This now makes me think how many more buyers have gone through what I have? I think the reason why there are so many good ratings of the sellers on AliExpress is because they blackmail. In order to get your refund, the seller asks for a cancelation that  doesn’t hurt their rating. Also AliExpress doesn’t accept PayPal, which takes more time to get my money back and less safe of a purchase. I don’t think I’m going to use AliExpress unless they change a few things.",2018-01-26 17:27:48,OpenlakesReviews
176,Great app but,False,4,"This is a great app as you can’t beat the deals and prices. But the problem I have is some of the sellers. Some of the sellers don’t ship the items on time and you have to reach out to the sellers. Some sellers do reply back but then the item is partially shipped. The rest just leaves you on read and don’t even reply back. But when they do reply back it  takes forever when the shipping is complete. There are some that are scammers, but at least you didn’t lost thousands of dollars. Lately it seems a lot of these shops I’ve been shopping at has been having problems with shipping. Some of the items have been shipped but it would past the date when it should’ve been delivered. Good app, but the communication and the shipping really needs some work along with delivering on time or early.",2022-10-17 07:03:39,lateggt
177,Dispute Dept is bad,False,3,"I love the affordable items but when I didn’t get an order I made after 60days and put in a dispute, they told me that my dispute is invalid and wanted proof of not receiving it. Well, if they look at the tracking log, it showed that the order was sent back to sender because “no such address was found” (they mistyped the street name) and the order was logged to be sent and delivered back to sender. Omg they should just see their tracking log to see the proof is there!!! I guess this is what happens when you deal with people who don’t read and understand English well enough before assuming the customer is wrong. I have decided not to refer this site to others anymore incase they run into the same problem that I did. I replied again with evidence but no one is replying back. So this means this place took my money and don’t care if I got my order or not. Very bad service.",2021-06-10 04:14:01,vivian Vaj
178,Misleading Factors,False,3,"I am disappointed because I feel that some of the items have false and confusing information provided. I ordered a dress for a particular date. I paid for an expedited delivery so the dress would arrive before the event. The seller contacted me and said that they need an extension on the arrival time. I asked when it could the item be guaranteed by and they didn’t reply. I waited in hopes that maybe I could still receive the item in enough time. 
Unfortunately, the predicted shipment date is WELL AFTER the date that I needed. I also was prompted to wait until I received the item before I could start a refund. So I now have to wait until it arrives later then the original date that was guaranteed to me and I guess I’m stuck eating the cost of the expedited delivery fee also. Please be Leary not to anticipate that rush delivery is truly available because in my case it was NOT !",2021-05-17 22:43:29,Sweet Savage Redlipz
179,Garbage app,False,1,"It used to be ok, some annoying things like misleading prices where they show a picture of the item you want with a low price, but then when you enter the sellers page, you find that something unrelated is sold for a low price and the item you actually want is way more expensive, essentially clickbait. 

Shipping has always taken a long time (a month) but recently takes 3-4 times as long. 

Customer service is non-existent and the dispute feature is practically useless. I ordered something 3 months back and it just never arrived and then suddenly just said delivered. I dispute it and they said the seller will get back to me but the seller doesn’t contact me and decides to just open another order that doesn’t show up under my account and is trying to resend me the order which will probably take another three months. Like no, please. Just talk to me and I can let you know I just want a refund at this point. What’s the point of an impulse buy if you can regret it over six months and still not have it.",2020-06-01 19:20:45,Hey2man
180,Good app 👍🏼,False,5,Good deals. Overall pretty happy with with app. The filters on app aren’t perfect. If you choose “price: Low to High”. It doesn’t take into account the cost of shipping. So you will get the ascending cost of just the product from vendor to vendor but there is no order to the shipping that comes with each one. This makes shopping a lot more time consuming when you are pricing items looking for the best overall deal. You end up having to literally scroll through every single item to assess what is the cheapest. One especially good thing is that a lot of vendors offer discounts if you purchase over a certain amount. Like “Spend $10 get a $1 off coupon”. Or $2 or $3 off. Very generous. Thanks AliExpress and sellers. I’ve only had good experiences.,2022-04-27 18:02:45,Biggg Miggg
181,Purse review,False,5,"Overall, I absolutely love ma bag,I love having an everyday bag that’s big enough to carry all of my stuff and still look chic.I love being able to have a beautiful tote to complete my outfit and be very functional.

If you are looking for a good quality and a trustworthy seller this smaller is for you.

I also love how sturdy this bag is. I can carry it to everywhere and had a TON of stuff in here and the handles are extremely sturdy / durable. I have other totes where the handles have started to fray or the bag starts to crack because they weren’t meant to carry over a certain amount of weight, but not this one!!!Is extremely sturdy and you never have to worry about overloading it ,I’ve read other reviews about this bag saying they have had it for years and years, carry their laptop along with alot of other heavy items and the handles and leather are still in perfect condition.

Along with the “sturdiness”, I also like that this tote isn’t flimsy. No matter how much or how little you have in it ,it holds its shape really well! Again, no cracking whatsoever given the amount I carry in it every day! It’s also super easy to clean and wipe off .

Very happy with my purchase and thanks to the seller , very communicative,able to answer all your questions,",2020-08-15 17:45:39,vtiburxio

I just started my buy and sell clothes company I have downloaded fashion nova, shein etc I try buy from all clothing online to help my business, when I go to AliExpress I love everything that I saw when I start using it some of my orders can go through and some can’t I have purchase serval items I was from good and can’t wait to reserve my goods then finally my goods reach my down body shut down I was so disappointed I even thought that doing this business I will only lose my money, the clothes material ain’t good and the size wasn’t right like they did have a good judgement I have shop from fashion nova etc and I never have a problem I think AliExpress GL store is only ripping-off people 
I have ordered several goods before I received the first set I have canceled my order about 3-4 day ago and now this morning they tell me my order have been shipped am not happy with my this app",2021-01-18 17:04:08,bf worldfam
183,Love,False,5,"I used to use Wish a lot but their items take a long time to get to me, like months. Also it's very common for sellers to list no-brand junky stuff on there, and with misleading photos. Also they have gimmicky ""free"" items. 

I love Aliexpress, items arrive within three weeks or less (gotten a lot of stuff within two weeks). Items are accurate / match the photos. Shipping is usually free with the choice of paying a little extra for speedier shipping. There are a surprising amount of legit high quality international brands on there like Teclast, Xiaomi, Huawei etc. Sellers care about your order and reply quickly. And best of all, Aliexpress is really fast to respond to any disputes you have. Received a broken item and they refunded the money the next day. 

Tldr: Love Aliexpress. Great items and support, way less sketch than Wish.",2018-04-17 04:47:05,mallowdrop
184,Disputes Are USELESS,False,1,"Will Be 1 Star Until Aliexpress Fix!!! Used to LOVE this app until one of my packages got lost in transit and saw how Aliexpress handled disputes. My package has been missing for a month until I opened a dispute and all they keep telling me is to WAIT because packages might be delayed. The problem is that the package reached my post office already but has never been scanned Delivered (which obviously means it hasn’t been delivered). I tried everything before I opened up this dispute. I went to the post office to see if I could pick it up but they told me it was not there and they’ll contact me for any new information (it’s been over a month). I filed a USPS lost package claim in which they CONFIRMED THAT MY PACKAGE HAS GONE MISSING AND THEY DON’T KNOW WHERE IT IS. Aliexpress is siding with the seller on this telling me to wait for a package THAT IS NOT COMING and I don’t know if I will get another chance to dispute. I feel for the seller as it is not their fault in this however, I PAID for an item that will NEVER arrive. Disappointed.",2020-05-13 06:28:07,Katieelolz
185,Highly recommend this App!,False,5,"Great app to use to find cheaper and similar items that you see small businesses trying to resale at a higher price! Yes shipping takes long a lot of the times! Anywhere from 3-5+ weeks, but usually shipped within that time frame! I always order my stuff in advance if I find something I really want. Reading reviews is a MUST when ordering unless you want to just wing it because the price is super cheap. However you might receive something with very low quality (but you get what you paid for) but NOT all shops on this app are the same! I have found MANY items that are great quality and some that aren’t such great quality! All in all, Do your part on leaving reviews as it helps the next buyer out! :)",2020-12-15 21:07:23,ToniCicale

Now here’s the but, the sort and filter choices don’t ever just show me what I am exactly looking for it’s all over the place.  Shipping, I am sure you have heard this before but it seems to take forever for the product to get here and some companies don’t deliver to the USA.  I know there’ll not much that can be done but it would help if the site old filter out what can’t be shipped to me, instead of spending a lot of time picking out the perfect product only to find out you can’t have that one. That to me is not only a waist but very frustrating. In conclusion I hope you find this helpful and maybe fix my issues.

187,ALIEXPRESS NEEDS TO GET RID OF SHIESTY SELLERS,False,1,"It’s the shiesty sellers that sell goods & send a totally differentiation from what was photographed. If it’s not a different item sent, the quality is so poor you’d think a small child made it. Not acceptable. I think they should be banned from selling. Also they need to do a much better job with shipping & tracking numbers. Once you buy it, it may end up in Oklahoma but you live in Chicago. Everything is a risk with our good friends in China! 👎🏻

Update bec I’m not sure when I wrote the above review... I think the sellers should be screened more throughly still. You can pay for expedited shipping and they’ll still ship the slowest way to save money. This is a hustle for most of the sellers.  ALIEXPRESS needs to hold them accountable and only allow verifiable resources sellers on this site, not anybody trying to make a quick buck by posting a blazer, yet mailing a wash rag. Shipping should improve & the quality of the item you post should be exactly what we receive. Stop using the same cheap fabrics and actually produce quality products.",2019-11-23 21:55:25,Yoko9982
188,Legal Scammers,False,1,"Guys please DO NOT buy from AliExpress I have
made many disputes to let them know that my
items have not arrived and they did not care at all!
They told me that I have to return the items and,
I'm just like how will I return the items when they
did not arrive? and then they told me to show
proof that it didn't arrive and I did do that and they
still did not care. They sided with the seller, closed
my dispute and completely took my money from
me.l also had another issue where I asked for a
refund and they emailed me two months ago and
promised me a $20 refund with no return because
I'm a ""valued customer"" and they still have not
given it to me so I contacted them about it and
they proceeded to blame it on me and say it's my
fault that I did not get my refund be I did not return
the item when they literally told me I could get a
refund with no return so once again they took my
money from me. AliExpress has stolen about $170
from me I will no longer be buying from here again
and I encourage you guys not to buy from here
either I have also had problems where I have
written bad reviews and they deleted them just so
no one can see it I've also seen other people on
the app say that AliExpress sellers are framing
them and saying ""if you don't give me a 5 star
review we will keep your money from you and not
give you your item""which is so ridiculous these
AliExpress people are absolutely disgusting…",2022-06-13 22:34:13,TortilasErm
189,Favorite place to find the best fashion and deals,False,5,"Always check the reviews before ordering to make sure your buying from a good seller, for shoes unless it says take your normal size or the reviews say it fits smaller or bigger order a size half a size or size bigger, for clothes I always order 2 to 3 sizes bigger then you because Chinese sizes are smaller due to most of us Americans loving food a little too much lol, if you find something cute chances are you can find it cheaper and with free shipping so screenshot products and picture search it to find it cheaper, remember that shipping will take at least a month or so so be patient and if you don’t get your product as advertised or not at all you can contact customer support and get your money refunded but it will take a week or two.

190,Always Satisfied....,False,5,"I’ve been a customer for 6 years now. I purchase jewelry supplies like gemstones for example. I’m ALWAYS satisfied! Sure it takes awhile for items to arrive within the US, but that’s to be expected. It’s worth it to me to wait up to a month for items. Ordering from these companies within the site enables me to purchase something really nice for only $3.99 (for example) instead of what I would pay here which would be $10 for the same piece. This is where all those sellers purchase from also, but then jack up the prices by 1/2 or more. To be honest... I really wish I could purchase my supplies from USA small businesses but like most... I simply can not afford to do so. Do I feel guilty about that...? Absolutely. But what can I do?",2021-08-29 00:18:55,Stolinstang
191,Sonya Reiser USA,False,4,"I was hesitant at first to use this app. I made a couple of small “test” orders to see how I liked it. I order frequently from “Home” app and used it as a comparison. Ali has a much greater selection and comparable or better pricing. Some sellers don’t seem to accept PayPal which is the only way I’ll pay, but most of them do. I’ve found you need to order more than $5 from a vendor for PayPal to work consistently. That can be an inconvenience as even though all items are placed in your cart, they are separated by seller and each store must be paid individually. Even with this slight inconvenience I am still happier with the selection and pricing on AliExpress. My test orders took longer than I had hoped to ship, but the Corona Virus was active so understandably it took longer to get orders filled and shipped. I recommend AliExpress very much and have already ordered more items.",2020-03-16 22:02:23,Nonny R

There App is very easy to use plus they deliver quickly and some items there is no charge and some there is a charge so be sure and check the shipping fees.  I have used them over 100 times and the only problem I have had was not receiving an item and that was quickly resolved by contacting the seller or opening a dispute in either case I quickly was refunded.

193,Good app !,False,3,"I buy from Ali express very often . I have brought maybe over 30 purchase on Ali express and for the most part all of the sellers are nice and ship items fast . Most of them even check in week to week to make sure you don’t have any questions and check to make sure your satisfied with the item which I love ! . I have had only very bad experience from a seller who was very rude to me and I had a dispute open for 3 months for  item that I never received and they refused to give me my money back for a 15$ fitness watch I was so disappointed and upset but you live and you learn . I will never buy from that seller again . I hope no one does because it was a disaster.  But anyway the app has awesome quality products from clothes , to phone cases , to household items , to toys , to personal , to facial and makeup . Even the jewelry . I love it and will continue to use this app just beware of some sellers .",2017-09-29 21:41:54,AsSedbyMe
194,Do not buy expensive items,False,3,"Here are some tips for newcomers like me:

- DO NOT buy expensive items. Sometimes one of my orders will go missing and it gets very annoying. 

*Therefore, it’s better to buy smaller and cheaper items (usually around less than 5 dollars each for me) so you don’t have to worry about losing too much money. I bought some stationary which costs only a few dollars each, so losing one item didn’t affect me. 

- Contacting the seller is pretty much useless. If you need to make a dispute, you need proof on your reason for a refund. It also takes a while for sellers to contact back. However, there are some instances where people stated that they received a response, but it’s pretty rare tbh.

- DO NOT buy too much. Just because most items are cheap doesn’t mean you can order a large chunk of items. Like I said before, items will go missing and it’s annoying after waiting for nearly a month for the items to arrive. 

*For me, I buy up to 15 small items at most. I would by less if the item is bigger, like around 4 at most. ALSO AS A SIDE NOTE, it’s best if you order items that are free shipping. It’s better to save money if an item never arrives. 

In conclusion, Aliexpress is good for buying cheap stuff but be very careful and do your research.",2022-08-02 09:03:27,Animegamefandom
195,No money back no refunds,False,1,For example I canceled my order 5 days after I ordered. So the seller refuse to agree with it eventhough the still wasn’t shipped so I contacted AliExpress agent and they said I will get my money back. Ok 3 days later when shipping time was up they shipped it anyway so now AliExpress telling me now its too late cause he shipped it. Now im out of my money and I don’t want the order see y’all lie so much and you rip people off of their money. See when I canceled it I suppose to have got my money back then. I shouldn’t have to listen to a bunch of lies and to y’all conartist sellers. This is the 4th time this happened to me. 8 years buying from y’all platinum status and it means nothing to you. Now you took my money and lied to me long enough for your seller to ship it. You don’t value your customers cause you back your crooked sellers. Now you wanted me to rate your app so their it is now what are you gonna do about it. NOTHING as usual but keep taking honest hard working buyers money.,2022-05-25 21:24:58,Rickeastwood
196,make sure to look at reviews !!,False,5,"so it is a great app with great prices and a range of aesthetics for clothes and whatnot. i use this app for clothes, and sometimes they don’t come as seen in the pics so i would recommend buying items with reviews that have pictures! it’s not the apps fault, just make sure the vendor seems trustable. also, most of the items come from asia, and asian sizes are smaller than western sizes, so you might want to size up 1 or 2 maybe even 3 sizes up, ESPECIALLY if you want baggy clothes to fit your aesthetic. overall, great app and very easy to use! you can also talk to vendors about your orders which is helpful, and it does keep track of where your order is so that’s good. quality of clothes might vary depending on the vendor!",2022-02-21 00:10:46,Missy Panda Girl

One of my purchases was delayed at customs and didn’t arrive until after the event it was ordered for. I try to allow at least a couple months but this one took a little longer. Customs is out of the sellers hands and I completely understand that so I just order as far in advance as I can and hope for the best. Very satisfied with everything I have received. Don’t order a $2 item and expect it to look like a $20 item or you will be disappointed. If you are getting something for nothing someone else is getting nothing for something. Please keep that in mind when you are shopping and getting good deals.,2019-05-31 15:55:03,Hoopstars13
198,"Really Good App, Be Careful Though!",False,4,"I’ve had this app for a while now. Typically I just buy wigs, but I also bought a prom dress from here. Everything I’ve bought came nicely & as described. You definitely have to be careful who you buy from, if the store doesn’t have any reviews, go to their store page and see if other people’s orders came as described!!! If a store doesn’t have reviews on ANY of their products or they have repeat reviews, do not buy from them because you can get scammed. A lot of people complain of being scammed but tbh they just didn’t use their common sense or do enough investigating. Also, people will leave bad reviews on hair, but don’t even know how to comb it, embarrassing but yea STOP! The ONLY problem is the shipping. It takes FOREVER to come y’all. But it’s worth it.

I do a lot of crafts from scrapbooking to jewelry making and I have a minor addiction to washi tape. ; ) So my money goes a lot further when I shop with AliExpress. Every once and awhile I will receive the wrong product or no product but someone is always friendly and willing to correct the problem. The only thing I would change is the delivery time but that is out of your and my control. That’s just part of the process and worth the wait for the deals I get. Hope this helps.

All went well - I actually haven’t experienced any issues, as of yet. I pay attention to items that have a decent amount of placed orders, the overall-rating, others reviews & the shipping fee. It is common for an item to be sold by multiple stores. There is the ability to track your orders. I just expect items to arrive in about a month or so.

Shopping at AliExpress for clothes is like shopping straight from the supplier and not having to pay for the marked up retail price. I have been shopping on online boutiques for years until I found out that all the clothes I have bought online are from people who resale clothes from Aliexpress and double up the price. I have never had a problem with a seller, I always check the reviews before I buy something. Some items do take 1-2 months to arrive but for the price that I’m paying it’s worth it.

202,Horrible customer support and worthless guarantee,False,1,"Aliexpress’ customer support is worthless.
I payed for three digital multimeters during their 11/11 sale that were sold with free shipping.  The vendor then demanded an additional $32 to ship the meters.  I contacted Aliexpress customer support three times.  The first two times they “assured” me that my meters would be shipped without me paying extra money.  The vendor then got a shipping number, but  still did not ship the meters.   I contacted Aliexpress again and asked for a refund.  They said they would not give me one, because the vendor had “shipped” the meters.  However there is a long record of messages between the fraudulent vendor and my self detailing his demands for more money, and that he has not shipped the meters.  When I said I would file a complaint with my credit card company, they said they would fight it because the meters were “shipped” so I should just wait weeks for their “process.”.  

I filed a complaint with my credit card company and explained the situation, including the long string of email messages I have with the additional demands for more money and the non-shipment.   They advised me there would be no issue since I have the email and screen shot records.

Aliexpress has full access to the messages between the vendor and myself, but they refuse to consider them because is not part of their “process.”  Thus their customer service guaranty is worth less than a steaming pile of dog excrement.",2018-11-28 20:23:29,batray

When I clearly sent MANY CANCELLATION REQUEST OF THE ITEM I ORDERED! The seller DOESN'T REPLY IS LIKE A ROBOT MY ORDER IS ON THE WAY WHEN I CLEARLY SENT CANCELLATION REQUEST TO IT I HAVE MY REASONS AND I NEED THAT MONEY BACK.",2022-02-11 18:51:10,amber marisol
204,From a 2 year user of the app,False,5,"I’ve had great luck finding nice quality items here. Shipping is always a long wait but it’s totally worth it. I’d rather wait then pay a fortune. I always get my mounted lights and other small items here.
I mostly shop here for rifle parts and other random things. When it comes to high dollar items, it’s always a gamble and 50/50 when buying knock off’s. I’ve had some luck with optics and other electronics and parts. Saved tons of money here. 
I have been ripped off once but I’ve also placed almost 100 separate orders. So for me, it’s been a huge win and advantage to be able to save money and afford more at once. Thank you AliExpress and all of its users, sellers and stores...

205,costumer service non existent,False,2,"Many things need to be fixed to have a greaat overall experience, first some listings have a deliverby date by or guarantee before date which is actually not accurate, when reaching CS all they tell you is to wait since seller provides a tracking number. After waiting months for an item I reach out to CS and all they is you need to wait 2 more weeks. After the 2 weeks you time to dispute has expired and cannot ipen a dispute from the app, no where it has a phone number to reach CS  basically leading buyer to take the financial loss. Some prices are cheap but if you compare adding shipping it actually cost about the same or  more the other online stores. Will not buy from this app until some of these things get resolved. Acurate shipping/delivery dates and better costumer service. I did encounter some great seller but in the mean time I will stay away, it too much hassle.",2021-03-06 15:47:30,Alejo89
206,It has its pros and cons,False,4,"The app is great so far but you can only really trust items that have a lot of reviews and likes from. That’s common sense. There are so many items that are on the app more then 3 times. So you have to be a good searcher to find that exact items but with better reviews. Also don’t get the item if there’s no pictures in the reviews. Cause one person might saw something good about the product that might not be true if they dont show the picture. That’s why, please when you purchase something and receive it later. Write a review truthful review with a picture as well. It helps people why more and puts us at ease knowing that the product is either good or bad.

AliExpress is using the same tracking number for all orders from same seller. We did received one of four bags so of course it’s going to show package was delivered . We disputed it’s showing delivered in the dispute Ali is stating to check with post office. The post office doesn’t have the additional bags. Seller only shipped one bag we purchased four. I order personalized outfits two different ones with my grandkids name seller mixed the size up on two and didn’t sent two. I lost the dispute because seller show a video of five items on a scale and envelope weight being the same. Smh This is really upsetting Ali need to fix this issue in the dispute. Another site is growing and there’s always eBay I will use those don’t have money to throw away like this.,2022-10-24 19:56:27,gagirl1970
208,AliExpress Shopping Vice,False,4,I have found myself spending a good amount of time just sifting through the vast amounts of stores & the various products some of which I would never of even imagined were actually in existence more less available to purchase & in general most of the items are extremely reasonably priced or far better priced than is found in comparison to other online sites selling exact same items.  I love all the opportunities provided to also save or earn funds to pay for or discount even more on pretty much everything.  I don’t even have the funds to buy anything sometimes but still enjoy just “window” shopping & seeing the seemingly never ending items that if I were rich & just had gobs of money to throw away obsessively on buying stuff just to buy stuff then this would be my online store of choice.,2020-01-10 21:32:49,ShugRe
209,Payment glitches,False,3,"While I love shopping on the Ali Express app and it has better functionality than the website I continually have issues with payment. I'll get a message that payment was successful then order will be closed and I have to Make an Appeal which requires me to upload a photo of my drivers license, a photo of my credit card and a cc statement. No way in heck I'm giving anyone a photo of my ID. They are losing a ton of business. I've also had issues when trying to buy from multiple buyers all at once. I get a ""Connection lost. Try later."" message and then orders are showing up as ""awaiting payment"" three and four times. Only way to delete them is one individual order at a time which is a 3-step process. Meanwhile your inbox is getting flooded by sellers wanting you to complete payment. Frustrating but I like the merchandise I have been able to purchase.",2017-09-23 13:16:46,Anemjamat
210,Really good for the most part,False,4,"So far, I’ve only had 1 order that was cancelled from the seller. When I did not hear back from them about resending, I requested a refund and received that within a few days from AliExpress! I have replaced the same order with a different seller, so we’ll see how that goes. (So far looks good on tracking). I have received 6 bags in beautiful condition between 2 separate orders. I have 2 more still processing and may update this later. (Dated 5/9/21). I think I have an obsession 🤣

Update: I received 1 part of my replacement order in the first week of June (still waiting on the 2nd item, even wit said my items were consolidated to 1 package) 

I ordered some wallets to match purses previously ordered & received within 1 week from ordering!! Very excited about that!!",2021-06-09 05:34:32,Kimbo0504
211,Don’t do it,False,1,I order from this site about four times if you have patience it’s the site for you some hair stores faster then others I order from princess hair store because of the delay of shipment after waiting almost two wks the response got less and longer and when I went to customer service to report that the store is giving me issues on canceling my order they was just as rude and non helpful after explaining that I don’t want to lie to cancel my order I was told if I don’t change why I’m canceling my order to another reason she will delay canceling my order after showing customer services the proof of this conversation I was sent the refund policy more then once so I taken it as f-you it’s nothing we can do follow the refund policy smh my daughter wedding I just wanted my hair done for my daughter wedding and customer services still didn’t budge after I told them the store prolong and lie for so long not even offering another option for the inconvenience,2021-01-19 11:37:30,dontdoitawaste
212,MAYBE MY EXPERIENCE WILL HELP SOMEBODY.,False,1,"I bought a leather jacket from a seller ($417 from AYUNSUE Fur Factory Store) but i didn’t know asian sizes were that much smaller than U.S. sizes. they say it’s 1-2 sizes smaller but it’s really 4-5. i wear a medium so i bought an XL & it was still maybe 2 sizes too small. so i did their ‘free return’ & printed their label & i took the item to the post office & they told me the package was too heavy for this label (did the company not know this? 🤔) mind you this return is TIME SENSITIVE i only have a few more days to return it so i paid for my own label (it costed $70) to make sure it’ll arrive in time. so i mailed it & messaged the seller the new tracking number & they told me it has to be the tracking number they gave me. but how, if the label they gave me was not usable? so yea, now i can’t get a refund because of a tracking number. $417 + $70 gone just like that. but good luck using aliexpress. oh yea & forget talking to a real person to sort out the issue, u only get to talk to eva the robot.",2021-11-07 23:40:10,ToucheAtl
213,Helpful to Customers,False,5,"I purchased a cosplay from a vendor through the app and was assured that my custom size request would be handled. They delayed processing my order, and after I received it the cosplay was nothing like it was pictured - and t was completely the wrong size! I tried contacting the seller first, but they only wanted to offer me $20 so I could 'find a tailor' to fix it, which was ludicrous considering that it needed to be taken out and not in, and that's not to mention the pen and ink stains all over the material. Anyway, I filed a dispute through AliExpress, hoping to at least get what I paid for the costume back, but they're refunding me for the costume and shipping! I couldn't be happier, especially since my other orders have always arrived faster than quoted and in perfect condition. Thank you!!",2017-11-13 08:06:24,Sarahbecc
214,You can find some good quality stuff if you look hard enough,False,4,"So a lot of my friends have had issues with this app in terms of shipping and quality, but I honestly cannot say the same. Things have arrived in the shipment timeline (which is always a minimum of two weeks and you to two months, but they did make that clear), and the shops I have ordered from were generally decent quality for an incredible price compared to name brands. There was one company I ordered from that obviously had terrible quality and workmanship, so I requested a refund, which I received within a few minutes. So I’ve honestly had a great experience with it. But many others I know have had not so great experiences. So maybe it’s a bit of a risk. But the pricing to me makes it worth a shot.",2021-01-22 12:49:09,Nate Mulcahy
215,Life Changing,False,5,"This app has definitely helped save me SO much money on items I would otherwise have to order locally. It’s funny that American’s complain about cost, but we are the ones ripping each other off to make a profit 🤔 The app is easy to navigate, offers a massive selection of items, and has become a staple in our household. As long as you have the patience to wait for your order, you will save more than you could imagine ordering directly from the manufacturer. The photo search option is Incredible and you can find LEGIT ANYTHING by using the technology. See something advertised on social media?? Search for it on AliExpress and I guarantee you will find it for 1/10th of the cost. Happy Shopping!!!",2022-02-07 01:56:02,VinylGoddess
216,The app is ok but..,False,2,"The market place is terrible. Sellers on here just try to rip you off and most of them get away with it. The market please don’t really punish them for misbehaving so they keep doing it.  The shipping is a problem where it takes a very long time or sometimes don’t show up at all. The parts are either substandard or defective stuff that should have been thrown out and the prices are really high as compared to eBay. A seller sent me a part once that was missing all its screws, they wanted to charge me extra just to ship the parts that they forgot to put in. When I sad no they ask for my credit card so that they can check my address, no way crooks. Good luck on reaching the seller is something goes wrong. I don’t recommend spending more than $10 on an order because you will probably loose your money.  Banggood and eBay are way better apps for shopping than this.  At last those sellers are held to a higher standard.",2019-10-29 22:29:57,Sc4367
217,Variety of nice merchandise!,False,5,"Ali Express is a hit or miss…. Mainly because there are so many different sellers. The sellers could be just putting out any kind of product to sell just to make money or the seller could be one to care about what they sale, how they ship and honest. I’ve dealt with both types of sellers. 95% of my purchases have been awesome! And the 3-5% is a loss. None of us hate to loose our money, but I’ve noticed on the less than 5% of disappointment is of the seller not supplying a return label and wanting me to pay for return when I’ve already paid for shipping. The return to China is expensive. I’ve ended up keeping items purchased that I didn’t like, couldn’t fit, or was not described as on the site.",2021-10-26 02:47:09,Shon White

Really though this app has pretty much everything you’re looking for we can take a little while to get to you, that’s the difference in price that you’re paying for two days shipping and having it right now someone else waited that wait and then sit on the product until you ordered it that’s where the extra money goes. So if you have some upcoming projects you can get all sorts of electronics and chips on here at a good price, just try to order ahead of time leave yourself a decent window. It also has a lot of electronics and handheld gaming systems at decent prices, go ahead and order your Christmas now though.

219,Best Shopping app for patient & money saving people,False,5,"OKAY !! So you could literally get anything you want from this app FOR A LOWER PRICE, THE ONLY THING IS that you’d have to be Patient with the shipping which normally takes like 14 days, sometimes shorter sometimes longer. The more expensive the item, the faster the shipping ( most of the time) but a good thing is that ever single last item has shipping options. 

I literally took $100 and bought about 5 shirts, 1 pants, 3 pairs of sunglasses, 1 bathing suit, 1 pair of shorts, 2 bras, 1 skirt, and a couple of other little things !!!!! Now THAT IS SAVING MONEY!! the sellers on here are very reliable, you can definitely tell them apart from the inactive and possibly “ FAKE” ones. Reviews are helpful and don’t look sketchy & also the refund PROCESS is so easy and hassle free !!!",2018-08-01 23:35:53,OOCuteOO
220,Prices and shipping costs are great!,False,5,"I can’t believe how much less expensive these things are than buying them in smaller quantities off of Etsy!  Not all, but most of those sellers add a huge amount of shipping cost to Each item you add on, even though you already pay a chunk for the first item, and the additional items are tiny.   I understand you would add in a bit more as weight went up, but usually, if I bought say $50 in purse hardware parts (a pretty small amount in volume) my shipping would be at least $35.  And the parts were not cheap to start with!  If I ordered one set of something, shipping would be $6 or $7 about.  If I added a second, and so on, it would often be another $4 or so on average.  This is SO MUCH BETTER!!!  Thank you!!",2018-07-25 10:35:41,Seabreeezy
221,Stationary,False,5,"I really like this app, it’s super convenient for ordering things from Asia, like the latest stationary products that are not carried in other countries. I have also gotten some high quality art supplies on here. I like how they give out coupons and have different memberships levels with benefits. It can be hard to work something out with a seller when there’s an issue with an order because they are all independent sellers like on Etsy. So one shop may just send out your order again if something happens to it, and another might just give you a partial refund. So I guess it would be nice if their was more of a universal policy. Other than that I think this app is great, and would recommend it.",2021-03-12 22:25:57,Real Food Has Mud Not Blood!
222,They don’t protect their costumers,False,1,"I have been using them for a year now, but their customer service is terrible.  I am an active online buyer and know for sure that they don’t protect their costumes as others do. I highly suggest making sure the electronic items you buy are working in North America or otherwise you are going to waste your money because they don’t return or refund you. However, if you receive damaged goods, they will take months before deciding to reimburse. 
Recently I bought two cellphones have technical or software problem. After using them for 2 minutes or so, start generating hit to the level that I cannot hold them in my hand, which got my wonder of exploding in my face.  I provided them with videos to display how these phones have the problem. What I did, place the phones on a glass table and removed them to show the vapor that comes from these phones, and still, they refused to refund my money back. So, please be careful when you buy from AliExpress.",2018-07-20 02:48:38,USA customers

Although I have politely repeat it so many times.🥲 I’ve got into an argument with her because she is so stupid. She even said that the supplier insults me, what can I do? Bruh, I literally just want help!! Is that too hard to ask.🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Aliexpress is great and all, but fix your customer services please🤚🏼. 

I told her I want another agent to help me and that agent actually help me through it because Ava didn’t all. However, when I got her again for the second time, I told her that i want the same agent or just anyone. She ignored me and start playing dumb on me.😒 Bruh, I didn’t ask for this😐I just want to order my clothes and go.

224,Disgusting sellers everywhere,False,1,"It is insane the amount of adult products they advertise. I have never looked for those kind of products not even related and they appear on the feed as the “top product of the day” or even recommended. I have used AliExpress for many years but now I feel disgusted of the amount of sexual images I have to see while looking for crafts to do with my kids. I have spent about 15 minutes of my time trying to delete and block these pages but there are way too many. Now, I understand there might be buyers for those products, but at least people like me should be able to block those pages if we are not interested. My suggestion to the company is to invest money in working to fix those issues because these kind of complains are everywhere and your response of “this page is intended for 18 years or older” doesn’t help in any way. I am 30 and I am not interested in buying any of those products.",2021-04-26 12:23:00,FDLCal
225,Awesome + has exactly what I’m looking for! :-),False,5,"AliExpress has just about everything. Not only that— most of the things you can buy on AliExpress are way cheaper than those found on other online shopping sources. Now, if you’re into aesthetic clothing, stationery, posters, decor, or any particular aesthetics (like myself) then AliExpress is just the place for you. I’ve really gotten my aesthetic together with the stores and products I’ve found on this app. Again, these things are all incredibly inexpensive. The only downside of ordering from AliExpress is that the products can potentially take a while to arrive. In my experience, the product will arrive around the time the app says it will, which can be up to roughly a month or two. It’s worth it to me, though!! :-)",2020-08-16 08:02:39,Issisaisssi
226,The app is pretty decent but service is poor,False,2,"I haven’t had any trouble with the app itself other than the occasional software bug, page not loading, stuff like that. Aliexpress itself though needs work. Before I even was able to place an order they cancelled my order due to card payment verification problems. My bank wasn’t blocking the transaction or anything like that, Aliexpress cancelled the payment because of “verification”. They wanted me to send my account statement for the card I was using, a copy of the front and back of my ID, and the front and back of my credit card, yeah right. I sent them the front of my ID with most details edited out only showing my name and the front and back of my credit card with only the last four of the number showing, everything else marked out. Their process took about a week to “verify” but I have been able to order since they “verified” my card.",2020-01-22 15:16:30,Ptbrinson
227,"60 days later, STILL no delivery",False,4,"First time I’ve used AliExpress.  The app works well enough, but getting a produce to actually ship has been frustrating.  I ordered some simple USB charging cables for my iPhone.  60 days later and still no delivery.  I’m currently disputing my order and requesting a refund.  This was my first and only experience with AliExpress.  I will not be using it again.  What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

UPDATE:   I’ve ordered multiple items (10-12) from AliExpress now, and recognize it will take 6-8 weeks to receive anything.  While the long wait is frustrating (and probably avoidable), I am learning to live with it.  The products so far have been exactly as advertised, and the prices are incredible.  If AliExpress could somehow speed up deliveries (1-2 weeks), they could really be a strong market competitor, even in the US.",2019-02-22 03:26:58,Opiewheezer
228,MORE SCAMS THAN DEALS,False,2,There are some deals don’t get me wrong but you have to be careful because there Are also soooo many scams with these Chinese dealers. They can give you cheap quality products and it will look nothing like that picture. They will also bribe you to leave good comments for them early on so they can keep tricking people to buy from them once reviewing comments. I have also seen some sellers post comments as if they have received a order with fake pictures and all so be careful!!! I’ve used AliExpress for years because sometimes the cheap route is easier. Sellers also will take a long time to ship your order and one threatened me they wouldn’t give my money back unless I said for my reasoning “other reasons” so Again I say there are more scams than deals on this site after experience. Best bet is to ask someone you know about a product or someone real who has left review after a couple months.,2019-02-12 15:54:24,InJesusNameAmen
229,Internal problem with Ali Express generating wrong shipping labels,False,1,"I have been shopping via Ali Express for several years, now I am forced to stop because they will not fix an internal problem that generates the wrong shipping label. I have had close to 15 orders shipped to GREEN BAY rd vs the correct address GREEN TREE rd. My default shipping address on my profile is correct.
I have explained the problem many times to a customer service rep via Help Center but they apparently cannot fix the problem. There is no supervisor or manager I can communicate with. Seems to be very bad management if this problem can’t be communicated and fixed.
I am so very tired of “ordering then filing a dispute” then waiting for  retuned money because vendor has shipped to wrong address. In one case they even charged me for the shipping fee to return the item!. It is unbelievable that this problem can continue for so long. I cannot justify ordering anymore until the problem is fixed.

230,Love this app,False,5,I use it for a lot of my shopping; all my Christmas shopping for sure. It’s fast and convenient. I have been using it for 3 years now. Products are great. If I ever have issues with a product; I always get refunded if needed or am able to message seller and resolve the issue. Most products are trAcked which is great. They give you an estimated delivery time which is pretty accurate. I have have great experiences. I prefer Ali over wish because products are cheaper and shipping is free most of the time. Read reviews so you know what you are buying. Often times especially for clothes reviews will tell u to buy bigger or not. Look for high amount of people buying and star ratings. I love Ali express! I have had no issues and app is safe and efficient.,2019-10-30 03:50:30,marlm10
231,Consistently delivers a great experience,False,4,"This apps has always delivered and many sellers are top notch! We purchased everything from electronics to wedding dresses that needed measurements taken and we’ve been constantly impressed. 

Of course you should do you home work. Only buy from sellers in China, know when the Chinese Holidays are, and when you find a great seller continue to use them. But really many have been great. Check prices too, but AliExpress has done a great job keeping price competitive while other apps charge outrageous prices. For the first time in over 5 years I’m getting a lot of bad sellers. I’m pretty much down to only using certain sellers now, but bad sellers caused my rating to drop one star. The app, however, does offer some levels of protection and handling disputes.

Best buying app in the iTunes Store!",2019-12-08 05:22:58,Tmidiman
232,Fun app,False,5,"Definitely do your research and read reviews. You take a gamble either way but if the product has no reviews the gamble is higher. I have bought clothes and had hit or miss but it’s expected at such discounted prices. The goods mostly all ship from China. Some items have US shipping options but not all. Chinese shipping is typically FREE but does take 3 weeks-2 months for certain items to reach you. 

I have bought certain “branded” items and they are dupes made with different materials with low quality print designs so definitely don’t expect Prada to be Prada (which I never did) but the items can still be super fun & you might luck out with super nice things if you do research!! :3 

Phone cases are good typically — makeup can be hit or miss. Socks are awesome typically",2019-08-28 22:14:31,MaycieRay
233,It takes a little getting used to.,False,5,"I'm sure many people in the US are very hesitant to shop in a foreign country. I found that it’s pretty much the same as eBay. I only buy from vendors that have a good feedback and a decent order count. I’ve had a couple of problems here and there and they’ve all been taken care of. I had an issue were an issue arrived damaged and the seller kept saying I did it. Aliexpress refunded most of my money. 
 Once you get used to using this app, it works pretty well. Of course, you need to be patient because items are coming from China. I've Found some wicked bargains on here that you would never get anywhere else. So for me, it’s worth the hassle. Happy shopping",2022-08-09 08:51:24,chncer
234,Horrible sellers!!,False,1,I bought two items beginning of May and before finalizing my purchase it didn’t have my city so the app put my county and now my package was returned back to the seller in China and the seller is continuously arguing with about not returning my money back because it’s my fault for the address but the app didn’t have my city until after I placed the purchase there was my city. I honestly just want my money back for something I’m not gonna be receiving. Stupid seller wanna argue about not refunding me. Placed a dispute and seller denied my refund and doesn’t wanna re-ship my product unless I pay an extra $30 for shipping. I JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK HONESTLY IM TIRED OF ARGUING WIH MMTH THE SELLER!! Is there a number I can call or something rather than freaking talking to someone who isn’t helping me out. Customer should always have the right and this guy wanna argue with and I needed this for a gift and since they returned it I need my money to buy it somewhere else. I’ll never ever be shopping on this crappy app ever again !,2018-06-04 16:03:45,MarieGonzalez
235,I’ve been using this app for years!,False,5,"I’ve been using AliExpress for years, even before they had an app. To be clear, businesses sell through them, they don’t sell the items themselves so the quality you get really depends on the seller. I’ve had maybe one or two bad experiences with sellers but in a span of 5+ years I don’t find that to be too damaging. As for aliexpress itself, the app/website is full of pretty much anything you’re looking for. I’ve bought so many different things. The shipping takes a while for most things other than hair but the products or mostly from Asia so that’s somewhat understandable. Most of what I buy has free shipping which is awesome. No matter if the product is $200 or $.60. I definitely recommend this app!",2019-01-13 20:21:12,MilaBuyer

Now I’m having an issue abs AliExpress has not addressed my concern.  
I’ve had my PayPall account since 1999 without any issues.  I’ve been using this account to pay for items on AliExpress without any problems until now.  
Now when I try to use my PayPal account I am redirected to a page called Sandbox PayPal.   They want me to sign into my “PayPal “ account but says my password is incorrect and that they will help me set a new one.  This seemed suspicious so I went directly to my PayPal account where my  password worked just fine.  I feel that someone is trying to get a new password from me to hack into my PayPal account.

237,Love the site but can’t give more stars,False,3,The products offered and site it’s self is great BUT Ali Express or Ali Baba whichever is the parent company needs to do a better job policing who is allowed to sell items on their site. Over the past month I have been defrauded out of $60 on AliExpress. I received confirmation my package had been delivered but nothing arrived so I checked my security camera for the day the package should have been delivered. No DHL drop off. So I called DHL only to be told the seller requested a label/pick up but never actually handed the merchandise over. So for the past 30 days I’ve been waiting and tracking a bogus shipment. I blame Ali Express as you can see since it’s your site...you gotta do better vetting out who you allowing to represent your company name. I’ve disputed the money and attempted to reach out several times but no response from the seller or customer service.,2020-01-16 10:59:00,Cyn💁🏽‍♀️
238,One of my favorite apps,False,5,"AliExpress is super convenient and I’ve spent many hours searching through some of the awesome things they have available. It’s a perfect way to connect with vendors and it makes it extremely easy to find products. I also love all the random things I’ve purchased because they’re super cheap. I rarely buy items anywhere else unless I need them soonish because AliExpress always has them cheaper. If you don’t mind waiting and don’t need something right away, definitely search for it through AliExpress first! The app is also very easy to use. I just wish they allowed an unlimited amount of items in your shopping cart or unlimited favorites lists.",2022-11-08 02:41:36,AF1228
239,Easy shopping,False,5,Most orders using this app receive slightly lower prices than quoted on a computer. This makes shopping lots of fun ( I am having a lot of fun) Update: once items arrive in USA they are forwarded to another local shipper and there is no cross reference between tracking numbers. This makes tracking impossible. Great variety of products with many sellers offering even free shipping. I buy often from Aliexpress Aliexpress takes care of situations where the shipped item does not match what has been ordered. Very helpful by getting in touch with the vendor to straighten out problems. The app makes it easy to order & dispute items. I will continue to buy thru them due to reliability.,2022-09-17 19:59:09,Marnoldi
240,Thrilled 1st time buyer!,False,5,"This is my 1st AliExpress purchase and I’m kicking myself for not taking the plunge sooner. I can’t get over how quick my package arrived….18 days!! Less then 3 weeks! And that was over Christmas and New Years.  I have Black Friday stationery purchases placed in my own country (US) that I still haven’t gotten.  

And the quality is so good.  I think the whispers are true. Most Etsy sellers or other similar stationery stores—I think you know what I’m referencing—buy inventory on AliExpress and then charge 5-10x more then what it cost them.  I’m not noticing a difference in quality or number of pages or anything.  

My recommendation- save your money for the brand-names and then just buy everything else from here.",2022-01-02 14:44:14,Jennzich1012

Read the sellers reviews by customers before you buy they are spot on. You are ordering from overseas so remember it takes time usually about three weeks. I have used this app for years and have only had one major problem unresolved, because I didn’t follow the advice I’m giving you. The seller I am referring to has been removed. They are competing against each other for your business so check between sellers before you buy. One seller may be cheaper but not have free shipping. Remember when buying knock off items check all the dimensions. The golden rule applies here as with any other store, if it’s to good to be true.",2019-01-29 13:28:08,wishbringer143
242,Great site,False,4,"The site has been great to shop. I have only one complaint and it’s covid 19 related. 15 days to dispute an order is not enough time.  Orders are still coming in from MARCH that are past the 15 day protection.  None of the tracking has worked on these orders and sellers are assuring customers to not dispute an order because they say it’s coming.  They are providing tracking that may or may not be true to beg you to not file a dispute.  After the dispute window is over you never hear from the seller again.  You lose your money and no one knows the order is.  I think dispute time frame should have been extended for all March and april orders.  I lost a very large order like this. The seller was updating the tracking, begging me to wait, and it’s all not true.  I never received my order.  Sellers are lying.",2020-07-15 22:38:23,ShanMT
243,Fun App,False,4,"It’s addicting looking at things pertaining to your hobbies and interests, finding new things.  i have used this app for around 5 years and have always been treated fairly.  Alot of times I just find myself looking for cheaper options than just buying a ‘name brand’.  Being from the USA i don’t recommend clothes(bad experience) everything else i have tried has been to the quality expected.   fishing, hunting, accessories, gifts.  if ordering for the holidays make sure you order 2-3 months ahead, and i’d avoid clothes.  if there was one thing i’d do differently is have more info or where you could find more info on products rather than having to contact seller.  overall i enjoy the heck out of this app and am very satisfied with the customer service Ali provides and is fair and swift. thank you",2020-06-02 00:32:51,"tank6'2"""
244,I can tell you a lot!,False,5,"I been buying for 5 years in AliExpress, so far, everything is being great! You need to understand how it works before you buy it there and understand that will take 1 to 2 months to arrive to your location. 

1. There is something called ""purchase protection"" this helps you getting your money back if the product never arrived
2. make sure you communicate with the seller before and after you buy the product.
3. Read the description carefully, and if you have any questions just talk to the seller, if the seller does not respond you in 3 days then decide to look for another seller (you want a seller that communicates with you)
4. Colors can be different of the picture.
5. If your ""purchase protection"" is running out of time and the product have not arrived to your home, talk to the seller and ask or demand for them to extend the protection time, this allows you to be protect if the product does not arrived or get lost or whatever happens
6. Whenever you want to buy shoes or clothing in China they use Cm or centimeters, make sure you familiarize yourself with cm before buying anything. Measure yourself and make sure you go 1-2cm bigger.",2018-12-02 16:42:46,Lot of work?
245,Amazing AliExpress,False,5,"I absolutely LOVE this website!  It has plenty of choices for any and all categories. New items are always being added so looking through a category never gets boring. The shipping takes a little time to get used to, but it’s not that bad. I have ordered over 100 items from this site and only 1 thing has been damaged- and that could’ve been due to shipping. The grab bag I received was better than I expected, and once I even got a delivery that I didn’t order. Can’t say enough good tho ha about this website!!!!  The only thing I could somewhat complain about is that there’s not always a picture with the silicone molds for resin art to show what it would look like- but maybe that’s probably part of the fun. Love, love, love!",2020-10-20 03:51:04,Jazz1836
246,AliExpress is a SCAM!!!,False,5,"I'll be the first to admit that I like a good bargain. At first, I ordered small things and got them with no problems. However, before the pandemic, I made several purchases on this app and STILL have not gotten any of them. The tracking says the items were delivered, but not to my house! I investigated the delivery details and they claim to have delivered my items to the front office- I live in a house, there is no front office!!
When I reached out to them to try and get my money back, they said they only go by the tracking information and I can either leave my complaint alone or wait.
What exactly would I be waiting for if your tracking information shows my missing items as delivered?!?!

DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY!! Buyer's beware!!!!!",2020-06-29 17:49:15,SOL_in_the_US
247,A beautiful thing,False,5,I little trial and error and you quickly find the things that are wonderful and the things you want to stick with the original. I love ordering new cycling jerseys every year and 98% of it is very good quality for a small fraction of the cost of name brand stuff. There’s handful of items that I’ve found are totally worth ordering from Ali. I would also temper your expectations as far as shipping speeds and seller communications. Most sellers will respond in a fairly timely manner but a lot can be lost in translation and shipping speed to the US is not consistent but everything has arrived. I like to put in a couple orders in Jan-Feb and I get little goodies delivered all throughout the spring. I love it and I’m sure you’ll find all your own reasons to love it.,2020-05-27 03:32:28,oh by the way 101
248,I freaking love AliExpress and this app!,False,5,"Guys AliExpress is better than any other online shopping in my opinion. I get the products straight from the source without the up-charging middlemen for a fraction of the price. I’ve gotten clothing, cosmetics, household goods (stationary, plushie toys, a giant flying shark), dishes, jewelry, specialty items (like cosplay stuff), and much more for literally a fraction of the price. A pair of costume vampire teeth (including adhesive) that would cost $10-$15 in the US cost me $0.45 total on AliExpress for the same exact quality. I’ve only had two out of fifty-nine items I’ve bought turn out to be duds and this is the sellers fault, not AliExpress. With both orders that didn’t work as described, AliExpress took care of it for me and made sure I was compensated fully. Thank you AliExpress!!",2019-08-22 02:10:01,Praelia<3

PLEASE tell me what its happening with the shopping cart now now!??  Before, you could add 100 items max inside the shopping cart and it wouldn’t allow you to add more until you delete one item or more than one but now I see things are disappearing from my shopping cart!! It will let you keep adding stuff but at the same time the cart its only keeping the new items that you are adding and DELETING the ones that are in the shopping cart already!! 

I HATE THAT I CANNOT BUY A BUNCH STUFF FROM ONE SELLER ANYMORE BECAUSE THE SHOPPING CART WONT KEEP IT!!! WHEN THIS  WILL BE FIXED BACK!???",2019-09-06 20:42:02,JadeKamila
250,Guy crimson,False,5,"The pants are a little iffy to buy because from my experience it’s either there’s a complication with the shipper and it just doesn’t go through or it’s bought out. The good thing about that is that the companies selling their products text you and inform you about it and tell you to cancel the order or give it more time, so you have help not just by the Ali express helpers, but also the company. Overall it’s not perfect and has its flaws, but when it delivers its a great products.

Ps: a little advice I’ll give you is to not only look at the reviews, but also look at the pictures the costumers sent of the product, so you can get a better understanding of the product.",2021-10-03 14:01:11,O4real

253,App has numerous problems,False,2,"- the loss of landscape is a terrible change. Most phones and tablets work best in landscape 
- the various pages have terrible flow. You are taken to newest orders first. Duh. It takes many weeks to get product. Why show most recent orders when you know it's a long way from delivery
-after review, of confirmation, it doesn't take you were you were, but back to the beginning. China stupid!
-mandatory completion of review with photo is stupid also. I just submit s black picture
- and finally the killer. You dispute an order because it didn't arrive. You complete and order based on time and lock out dispute after a period, but if the delivery date has passed, get this... you ask for prove. This is really China stupid. Proof of what. And empty door step. This is why the world does not worry about Chinese dominance. Too stupid to accomplish simple tasks.",2022-06-11 02:11:18,Clifford D. Staley
254,NEVER HAVE PROBLEMS WITH RECEIVING PRODUCTS !!!!,False,5,"This place is great for making purchases over seas for very low prices with the flash sales and great prices period. Just make sure to look and do a little research about the seller before making purchases. Just like eBay you have bad sellers trying to make a free dollar, but AliExpress has your back if you have any issues with your order. I always receive my orders unlike with DHgate where I have ordered 5 or 6 items from them. I only have received 1 of those items . With AliExpress. I have ordered well over 10 items and received every one of those items plus some. The plus some are replacement items from a seller free of charge because of an item malfunction or damage from mail delivery.",2020-08-09 09:44:45,This guy 82
255,This app is rarely a let down,False,5,"Awesome app. I have had my issues with it where I don’t receive my order or I’m not able to hear back from a seller, but honestly these instances have been so few and far between, and when they do happen, the AliExpress customer service is always on point. Every item has been just as it’s shown in the photos and I know some people leave reviews saying otherwise, but honestly that’s on the buyer. You gotta read to make sure you’re getting the right item! Anyway, I would definitely recommend this app, or at least recommend trying it. It becomes a bit addicting after you realize and see how it works.",2022-11-04 01:11:17,PokemonGokillspuppies

I give it about a 3 because it’s very stressful and I feel like they should update their website a bit more so it works smoothly, I wasted my cyber Monday because I thought it would’ve worked so I spent all day shopping on there and when it was time to pay it didn’t work and I was very mad because like I said it erased my cart. I don’t think I’ll be using it again but when you do get the order I’m satisfied. No hate but just sharing my experience.",2022-11-29 03:41:10,aangelinaaaaaa
257,App Is Great! Some Issues...,False,4,"Aliexpress app is user friendly and simple to navigate. The sellers can be an issue due to nonresponse to inquiries about the product. Sellers need to do better in regards to customer service. The new “messages” feature is a headache, the old version was better. Overall, pretty decent app and products. Watch for sellers that don’t show “true” pics of items. Ask for actual pics of products before purchasing because some sellers have fake pics and send you something completely different. The free shipping was nice, now in 2020 since the Coronavirus hit, the sellers charge shipping and this will definitely make me stop buying. The free shipping was an incentive to purchase more. I used to purchase every week for years!!!",2022-10-23 18:47:37,pinterested1
258,Love love love the app,False,4,"The app is easy to use. Love that there are different sellers with similar items. I can compare prices. Definitely look at the seller’s reviews. Don’t want to get scammed. Getting a hold of customer service is not as easy. However, contacting the seller is. Not happy with the pictures of items purchased be taken down. Sometimes I would like to remember what I had purchased. Which purse since descriptions could be similar to another. Saving items to your wish list is kind of a waste since they might not be there tomorrow. Half of the items saved to my list is discontinued or no long shows up. Picture of items should at least stay online and marked as discontinued. I still have much to learn about the app.",2021-09-30 11:11:32,ileluzmay
259,Poor customer service,False,3,"The items that they have are a great price and you get the quality you pay for. Unfortunately the customer service is terrible and it can take up to one to two months for a dispute to finish just to receive your money back for order that was broken or never arrived. Some items are also misleading especially in showing a stock photo or a look alike item that is actually high quality to what you actually receive. So wouldn’t buy just based off pictures they show recommended looking at reviews. Also constant spam messages from seller for coupons that are like basically a dollar off if you spend more than $30 dollar in their shop. You can’t ever get a good discount really on anything, but tbh most stuff is cheap to begin with.",2021-05-18 05:32:19,Minimalmar
260,I’m always on here,False,5,"Iv used AliExpress for almost everything. If you didn’t know, I’d you don’t know what the name of the product your trying to find, you can take a pic of it or screen shot a pic from the internet and AliExpress will find it for you. It’s scary accurate. I’d say more accurate and faster than any image reversal app or service out there. Google needs to take notes. 

As long as you stick with buying items that have sold more than 100 and is above 4.4 rating, you’ll be happy with your purchase. BEWARE of products that have reviews that don’t sound talk about actually using the product. Be suspicious if it only says the item showed up fast or is in broken English, AND if it’s talking about a different product.. 

Another tip I wish I knew before is that sometimes you’ll come across some items from different sellers with fluctuating prices and shipping. And if you can remember that there are no sells tax on the shipping, you might save a few bucks. 

If you can follow the tips iv mentioned above. You’ll fall in love with AliExpress!

261,No guarantee you’ll either get the product or your money back.,False,2,"I’m Very disappointed with the way this company handles disputes with sellers, the lack of communication is annoying. They don’t really help you and there’s no professional support. I have bought a product that I NEVER RECEIVED, months passed by and suddenly I realized that the ‘expectation date’ for my order was in a couple of days. So I try to contact the seller and they only send a ‘thank you’ automated response. I open a dispute case to receive my money back and cancel the purchase order. the seller rejected my petition and it has been 2 months since that dispute and until this date the company hasn’t been able to contact me about it and I just feel that there’s no support on their end. So basically just make sure the seller is honest, but there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive the product or that you’ll get your money back.",2020-02-28 05:46:51,be@tr!x
262,The app has some serious usability issues,False,2,"You are constantly bombarded by ads for coupons and other things, all of which are useless. Coins are a nice thing when you use them on items and get two cents per coin but you have to use a ridiculous and childish system to “collect” them which is demeaning and silly.

Another issue is that almost all ships other than the ones run by truly good and smart owners engage in habitual lying and theft regarding what they sell and the way they showcase their items. Photoshop use is rampant and unpunished. Search pricing is absolutely not reflective of the final price - they can list another option which is something unrelated to the item sold in order to make the item appear to cost less aT first glance. In addition many stores use fake shipping costs to double or triple the cost in a way that is difficult to notice and that results in you losing your shipping costs when you inevitably return their defective items.

Try to buy exclusively from stores rated 96-97% and higher. Even better is to buy only from stores which have a clear management structure and presence outside AliExpress. Find shops which eschew cheating. 

Note to AliExpress: you must create some sort of simple reporting feature for mislabeling etc. It’s abhorrent how rampant cheating and theft are on your platform.",2020-11-08 10:37:25,seanhavs
263,Ali is great!,False,4,"For the most part, I am generally very happy.  CLOTHING has been my only issue. It can be difficult to order when the seller provides a size: “ONE SIZE FITS ALL”. And does not provide the actual measurements so you can determine whether it will fit you before ordering. It is both LAZY and IRRESPONSIBLE to say “ONE SIZE FITS ALL” because it is scientifically impossible!!  So I would suggest that you require sellers to provide the exact measurements in their ONE SIZE FITS ALL item and a measurement conversion chart should be required with all clothing. Returns are tedious and expensive. Sizes should be made very clear. 
Otherwise, as long as I am not being blatantly tricked by photos that are retouched, and items shown to appear BIG without the correct measurements to communicate the correct size, I am happy with the great prices. Thank you!",2019-05-15 21:20:43,Cheeeckee
264,It gets no better than AliExpress 🤗🥰🤑🙌🏽,False,5,"🗣🗣I’ve been ordering from AliExpress for YEARS now and I’ve ALWAYS been satisfied. What I love about the app is the shipping companies have a timed window to have your order shipped and received or you will be automatically refunded. Shipping waits can be a little long depending on what you order, but that is understandable due to COVID and shipping demands right now. This app is also very convenient for people who like to sell products due to the prices being very reasonable and the seller being able to make a decent profit!!!! I trust this app very much compared to other apps like WISH or EBay🙄. Great GREAT app! You definitely have a customer FOR LIFE with me! Thank you AliExpress!!! 🥰😘🤑😎🙌🏽",2021-05-06 09:26:13,Cobiyashi🥰
265,Best App Ever,False,5,"1st off Amazing customer service, if you ever have an issue they solve it within 24 hours. 2nd off everything is reasonably priced and you can find virtually everything from 50¢ to $100. It’s here. You can apply for free items as well and if you win you pay $0.01 to ship it and you rate it and it’s yours! Great app to buy random crap also, you can find everything on here to furnish a house but you also find items you don’t see everyday. Including Custom styled drawstring bags, Neon Signs for $12, clear jeans. I’m pretty sure my mailman is getting annoyed with the fact that I have 8-10 packages coming in every week. But overall I’m a loyal AliExpress Customer and recommend this app to anyone looking for a good deal, unique décor, etc.",2018-08-02 00:02:45,yaboiberg
266,This is a scam,False,1,"This app is a scam. I ordered an item because it showed estimated delivery time 30 days, but it showed me the max delivery time 2 months. “Okay, fine” - I thought. So 2 months passed, the last tracking update was 6 weeks ago. I submitted a refund request, and you know what? They invalidated my request, because they extended the delivery time to another 2 months, without even bothering to ask me whether I agree to it or not. 4 months delivery!!! What?? That’s insane. So they apparently can just extend the shipping time infinitely, and never return the money.

Also their Customer Service just doesn’t respond. There’s a bot that puts you in an infinite loop of asking you the same questions over and over again without letting you to speak to a real person. I’m pretty sure it’s done on purpose. 

That’s not a seller issue, that’s 100% AliExpress issue. Seller did everything right, it’s AliExpress Post (their delivery method) and AliExpress policies mess everything up.",2020-06-01 00:21:46,Sergey. I

Twice I have had this problem… I select option to write a review. But while writing I realize I need to take a picture to add, but I am not at picture site. So I stop reviewing, no saving or submission. Then later I am not allowed to write a review again. The order is totally deleted so I cannot do anything to correct the problem, as order number is not available. 

And lastly, this is the first time I have been asked to review the app. It has several bugs. Please allows users to discover and report them easier.

Item is coming from China to the US, no way it’s going to be delivered that fast. Seller read my many messages but did not respond. Ali gives you 15 days from receipt to file a dispute but my item would not be delivered until after that 15 days, item came and the screen print on the shirt was half cut off. AliExpress never updated the dispute and still had not solved the issue despite talking to customer support several times. felt like I was being scammed So I filed a charge back with PayPal but Ali won’t refund me unless I return the item, shipping costs more than what I paid for said item.

269,Ali Express,False,5,I’ve been using Ali Express for about 4 years and have made 50+ purchases. Great App to buy items that aren’t easy to find in the U.S. This app reminds me of a popular auction site that also offers “buy it now” option. Be sure to read full description before and ask seller any questions before making a purchase if you aren’t sure the product is what you are looking for. Shipping can take a few weeks  so I wouldnt buy items needed immediately. I’ve been satisfied with all purchases made and have come to trust Ali Express knowing I will receive my order or be fully reimbursed. I’ve recommended this app to many family members and friends.,2021-07-29 09:48:15,wesbruh
270,Good App Great Shopping,False,5,"App works well. Reliable purchases and orders that do have issues are resolved by timely by Ali.  I’m new to the platform but comfortable with making more purchases. App allows for good research of sellers and ALI gives a rating system to further help make safe purchases. Buyers also post reviews, so make sure you always check those listing to ensure you know the listed item was received and accurate. I avoid items that have no reviews or the seller/store looks sketchy. However, there are Tons of reviews from buyers that have been longtime shoppers to help choose reliable stores.  App  offers a search by your image to easily find what you want. As with all platforms be thorough on your research before purchase.",2019-09-23 18:07:23,Cross5967
271,Disappointing app,False,3,This app is getting on my last nerve. Only on this app my card keeps getting declined. It asks to pay in another way every time I wish to buy something. It gives me the creeps because once you put a new form of payment it allows you to buy something then let’s say a couple of minutes later you decide to buy something else all of a sudden card declined please use another card. Then I put another form of payment and again it works then I decide to buy something else and again declined enter another form of payment. Like seriously what the heck is up with this app! It literally wants access to all your form of payments. Very disturbing. Only thing I like is that they do have good stuff to buy but only if your form of payment isn’t declined.,2021-07-02 04:32:03,bebe_$$
272,Fair,False,2,This app is cool and has affordable nice items. Some nice vendors.. however when I typed my address in as an example “8008 peach tree” it changed it to “8071 peach tree” which was the address at my apartments decades ago and that address leads you to the middle of an intersection now.. and I ended up never getting some stuff because I didn’t I notice how it changed the address I had put in. Second there is no customer service hotline which would be convenient since some vendors might not communicate with you or if you have to file a dispute you have to trust the vendor to do what’s right or call your bank and file. Some vendors take a very long time to ship and others might not even respond to you. Just depends.. overall I had my items shipped fast.. and decent communication with the bigger sellers. Had to file 2 bank disputes.. you win and lose,2021-03-21 13:24:09,cathry28

Great contact with the sellers, good notification in regards to when your items have shipped or when they're in customs or when they have arrived.

You just gotta know your measurements and ask questions to buy your size but so far I have not recieved an item on here that has been bad.  Shipping takes a few weeks but im in no rush :) recently I had ordered something that didnt ship because the chinese spring festival and the store i bought from apologized to me and is including a free gift in the package.

Somehow the system defaults to Previous persons order information without me noticing it did that. I will be very careful if I order from you in the future. The earrings I ordered for someone came up for an order for earrings I purchased over a year ago. it appears that if I place order for merchandise that I have ordered in the past, it pulls up old order mailing information without my permission.

276,Great App! :),False,5,"This app is actually amazing, I just don’t recommend buying clothing though, unless you understand that the quality you are going to receive is cheap and worth the 5$ you probably paid. 
   I’m an artsy person, so I usually buy art supplies from this app, mostly from trust-worthy stores with the highest rating count, make sure your seller can talk to you, and answer any type of questions you have. If they can’t do that much then I would recommend looking at another store. But other than art supplies and all that stuff, I occasionally buy jewelry every now and most of what I have received is what I ordered!

I ordered variously items thru aliexpress, some seller were fast replying and shipping, but there are some of the seller are either slow reply or don’t reply at all, tried to talk to Ali online help, is all bot talking, sending people into loop cycle, never get the answer you want...the waiting time from country to country is maximized to 90 days ,so if you are rushing to get the items, recommendation is shop somewhere else.
Just saw a review from some others, wake up dude,most of shipping time by air should be less than 2 months ,usually if u pay normal standard shipping is around 2 weeks to receive items,in my case I ordered some items together at same day, some already sitting on my desk,and some still not ship yet,is the sellers slow reaction cause it, not the logistics issue..open your eyes.

They also have a buyers protection policy that protects the purchasers in case of any problems with your order occurs, so, you do not have to worry about ordering something and not receiving anything or not getting tour money back. They will reimburse you for the amount you paid out. That is a whole lot more than a lot of other sites/Apps will provide you with! So, now I’m a regular AliExpress shopper! Ive been so happy with all of the great deals I have purchased over the past couple of years!",2018-07-07 08:16:50,Robles Fam
279,"Very good app, with minor bugs to fix",False,5,"The app works well most all of the times, however every now and then it crashes. There are a variety of stores and products available, and you can find cheap but also high quality items. There is a good customer support from the app itself, which to my experience is a guarantee against frauds. The only minor points are few bugs causing for example the text not to appear when you type on the support site, and few stores not being clear with the taxes which must be paid for the products. In my point of view, taxes should be always included with the price, or in alternative, the amount to be paid for taxes should be clearly stated.",2017-12-12 07:21:18,MorganBsc
280,Made Unaffordable Medical Device Affordable,False,5,"Ali Express changed my quality of life and I’m no longer suffering from debilitating pain after purchasing a high-quality, essential medical device unaffordable to purchase in the USA. 

I prefer to support American  manufacturers, but local companies charge $3-4 thousand for a medical device that Ali Express offered an equivalent white-labeled version for $560. I needed to choose my health and quality of life I wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford at American prices. 

I will try to continue to support American businesses as much as possible, but Ali Express was a godsend for me in this situation. I am grateful for Ali Express and my experience with my seller superseded all my expectations.",2021-12-15 04:29:15,jamiesaari75
281,Perfection,False,5,"I ordered to see the quality so I can order more, I was so surprised the quality was so perfect. The finish and the Stainless Steel quality is good. I didn’t fix it as we will be moving to a new home next month and want to use there, I tried to test with the existing sink and it worked so perfect. I really appreciate the quick delivery. It was noted online that it will be reaching by Mar 1st or so, but I was surprised to see a package delivered by 3rd Feb itself. It’s incredible and it fitted the US standard fittings and no leak at all though I just hand tightened those fitting to test. I love this product and looking forward to install at our new home. Will be ordering more and recommend fully.",2021-02-05 00:33:28,Sarav_US
282,Do not order anything from here,False,1,"I ordered three items in a combined package. I have been keeping up with the tracking details. It says it was delivered 4 days ago but nothing. So I used the tracking number on two different websites. They say it was delivered to Herbon Kentucky when I ordered it to Pennsylvania. Tried to message the shop owners and file a dispute. My dispute was rejected because it was “invalid”. This app is a scam, I looked it up and it has happened to many other people. They have no customer service number or email to get ahold of them with. I paid around 30$ on this order. There is no way to get my money refunded because the dispute was rejected. Do not trust this app, I wasted my hard earned working money on the three items I got, and was left so disappointed. Was really excited to get these items even though the shipping took so long. Ali express if your reading this, shame on you. SCAM!!",2021-05-21 14:36:28,kate556718
283,AliExpress,False,5,I have been ordering from AliExpress for a long time now I order a lot of my puppy clothes from them they are the same ones you see elsewhere for double the price my pup has a lot of clothes thanks to AliExpress I have even ordered designer pet clothes that are $40 somewhere else and they are the same Thank You AliExpress for letting me dress my puppy in style! I’ve ordered lots of other things which I have no complaint about I’m very happy to wait alittle longer to save money I’m on a Social Security so every dollar counts. If you haven’t ordered from them yet please give them a try they won’t disappoint just be prepared to wait and they are way better than Wish!,2022-10-11 15:10:24,Lisa2067
284,"Day after day, getting worse in everything!",False,1,"AliExpress protects the sellers all way long, and on the contrary against the customer. Seller would be late to ship, and AliExpress would inform you to wait and if you don’t want to wait, you still need to wait for another 72 hours to obtain the approval from the seller (who has already didn’t ship nor process the order) and the seller must accept canceling the order to refund your money, what a joke. Further, if late to deliver and it’s due, they will inform you to wait for additional 30 days so, they will refund your money. So they’re retaining your money for 4 months, then refunding it. During this time, whether they’re investing our money in other funds or just protecting unqualified sellers abusing their platform, I can’t tell. All what I can say, I shall delete the application. Other better market platforms and shopping online are everywhere, without wasting my time and money for 4 months.",2020-04-11 00:28:05,Boomerang dude!
285,Awesome app. always refund my money and the items are cute and affordable,False,5,"Awesome app! I've been using Aliexpress for a long time and im always happy with my purchase. i trust this app alot, they always refund my money whenever i need to refund. i needed to refund a huge amount of money and the store i bought still refund me back. aliexpress also refund my money whenever a seller have to cancel. very trustworthy and there are so many cute items that are so affordable to get. i got so many clothes and stationery, plushies from this app. Amazing shopping app. Definitely my favorite app for online shopping, you can find so many cute things that you can't really get in real life  :)",2022-02-24 05:46:22,cutelisa00
286,Just Read the descriptions first,False,5,I’m usually always satisfied with my purchases from this app/site. As long as you read the descriptions of the products carefully and keep in mind that most of their measurements are in centimeters vs inches and be sure to check out reviews others have left you’ll have a good idea of what you’re going to receive. And if you’re not satisfied the majority of the sellers have no issues with fixing the problem you just have to let them know you’re not satisfied. But I’ve been making purchases from them for more than 6 years now. They’ve become my go to place for a lot of beauty products and materials.,2021-03-12 03:20:15,IG:LolaLauren
287,Love this app!,False,5,"Listen, if you’re going to buy from random sellers in China, it’s going to be a win some lose some situation, but when you find a good seller? It’s really good! Especially for the price. I’ve gotten many things from here for cheap, butterfly clips, shorts, bras, and other accessories and products. Another thing is it usually takes a long time to ship. But for the price, it’s worth it in my opinion. I’d say give it a go, even if you only have a few dollars! It’s not like other sites where there is a ridiculous shipping fee, most items I buy have free shipping. You can even search for things by picture. I do not suggest buying perishable items like food or skincare products, but that is up to you.",2020-05-26 22:18:57,laylabug1208
288,Honestly a great site,False,5,"AliExpress is 10x better than Wish. I’ve ordered 50+ items from AliExpress and so far, all of them have worked perfectly fine and looked like the picture. I don’t buy clothing or shoes here but I’ve bought one shirt from here and it’s one of my favorite shirts. But I don’t recommend using AliExpress to buy all your shoes and clothing. If so, READ reviews. There is a lot of duplicate brands, so if you buy a “name brand” item, it’s probably off brand so just read the description carefully. I come on here a lot to buy random things and it’s been great. anyways, I haven’t had a bad experience with AliExpress, other than the shipping is pretty long but that’s expected.",2020-04-28 02:39:34,nortorioususer
289,It’s ok,False,3,"It’s a good app to shop, but they push useless sales and suggest a whole bunch of stuff you don’t want. 
The freebies and the “coins” are good concepts, but;
Anything you can buy with the coins is already sold out, so your only option is to basically use coins and pay a couple cents cheaper. Not worth it. 
As for the freebies, these are intended to spur feedback on product for others. Except, they’ll only approve and publish your review if they like it, so the idea of honest feedback it out the window. Not to mention there are thousands of people all trying to register for a chance at one item. You hardly ever win. I’ve won twice, but the first time was some outfit and when I requested the size needed, I was told no and the freebie was canceled. I suspect that the amount you win is related to how likely you are to give positive feedback.",2020-05-23 02:09:28,BobSkillman
290,LOVE ALIEXPRESS,False,5,"So I’ve always been on AliExpress for a couple years just looking at things cause the prices seemed too good to be true but now that I’ve actually bought things here and there for more than a year now I’ve only ever been satisfied. I’ve ordered a backpack, scrunchies, bikinis, phone cases ( lots of them ! ), my PROM DRESS, and most recently am AirPods case. All of these items have ALL been great, 10/5 I would totally buy again. The only thing that I would consider before you make a purchase is patience. You’re going to need A LOT of it, I usually don’t care about how long it takes because most of the time I forget so when it arrives, it’s like a present. Other than that I will continue shopping from them 🥳",2020-01-10 19:16:58,iinfatuationss
291,The best place for shopping for a bargain,False,5,"I have been using AliExpress for years for all types of things and I am always satisfied! Make sure you read the customer reviews before purchasing though, otherwise you could buy from a company and never get the item or something crazy. Me on the other hand, that has never happened. The shippers are always friendly as well. Only problem I have is that some items take 3+ weeks to get, so make sure you order ahead of time!!! They also have many vendors that allow you to buy in bulk, so for those who are aspiring business owners, starting a small business from selling items through AliExpress merchants is a great way to start!!",2019-12-23 21:48:02,Monique_1234
292,Loving This App,False,5,I have to say I was a little on the fence about this app well all apps. But I downloaded n fell for it. I’ve placed over 5 orders and I am satisfied with all. If ur new users MAKE SURE TO READ THE REVIEWS IT HELPS A LOT. THANKS. i’ve been use n buying from aliexpress since december i believe n trust me when i say i’ve ordered probably close to 40 different things n i ve only had to open 1 dispute with a store. the tracking keeps saying i’m tht i had received or it had reached final destination. for weeks now. but i still haven’t received anything from them. other then tht satisfied 100% everything tht i’ve purchased is made of good quality and great deals. i give 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,2022-08-13 19:46:30,Shawnjessie
293,Seriously the best kept secret,False,5,These guys are the perfect in between of SHEIN and Alibaba. The app keeps improving. Only issue is it says I am not certified for certain things while my friends are able to get access. I would assume that if I were to uninstall and clear cookies that it might all work but unfortunately I really don’t want to do all that because I have things that are being purchased for work and for personal so I just don’t want to lose anything but until then I guess all the deal with it. The app though in itself in the company is really great I have no problems so far I’ve had more problems with Macari than I have ever with AliExpress,2022-03-07 20:01:32,Zmommy777
294,pay attention to reviews and size charts.,False,5,"Definitely a go to shopping app when on budget and don’t want to pay boutique prices for the same items. Pay attention to size charts and the reviews!! 

Shipping differs sometimes, items can arrive fast within a week or 2 weeks or it could be a month+. I had maybe 2 issues where items didn’t arrive at all, but I was refunded. I’m glad that they updated how orders are shipped. Now, when you order several items from different sellers they consolidate them into one big package depending on how many items you ordered. I no longer receive 1-2 items at different times.",2022-01-01 22:50:32,leavdme
295,AliExpress,False,5,We placed about a $300 USA orders with them. When something has been wrong they have messaged us that they will give us the refund. Yes due to it is from China I’m realizing a lot of the stuff is made very small. So if it gives you a option which it doesn’t tell if it’s China or USA made on a lot of the stuff. Which makes it hard to choose the size. My order that came today was missing the shirt to the shorts. I have another dress out there like the one that came today. But so far so good. I’m just going to be trying to write the names of the stores because some of them are not a good quality or do not fit properly at all and others are excellent,2021-06-18 03:51:33,Sandy056
296,Affordable & Reliable,False,5,"I have been using AliExpress for over 2 years. Before writing a comment or review, I wanted to see how my experience would be first hand. And wow, I am not disappointed. I have made 5-8 purchases in the last 2 years & all of my packages have arrived in a timely manner. I think the fastest package delivery was within 8 days and longest was 16 days. & I sure wasn’t upset about that. Also everything I purchased meet my expectations and some of the quality was better than my high end clothes/designer clothes I have in my closet. So overall I am extremely happy and will continue to use AliExpress. If anything changes I’ll be sure to make updates here!",2021-02-21 01:41:48,Fabbie121212
297,"Great deals, but check reviews and sellers first!",False,5,"I love shopping on AliExpress. The deals I find really get me things I need at a price I can afford. They always help out when there is an issue and take good care of customers. Any issues I’ve had with damaged items during shipping, or a product defect were always taken care of promptly and to my satisfaction. I appreciate it! Thanks! For all you reading this, download the app! Find something you want? Look at reviews, pictures, ask questions, message sellers, and make sure everything is correct! Then buy something! Sometimes shipping can be up to a month or so, but the savings is worth the wait...",2021-02-11 19:12:36,トレバー　シルバス
298,It’s not bad for “fast fashion”,False,4,"Others aren’t fond of fast fashion but I will say this app will find you everything! To trendy fits or cool room decor you’ll get everything! People are worried it’s made by little kids in factories which I can’t confirm but products are nice, takes awhile to ship but it’s okay since it’s in China. App provides many opportunities for coupons and deals which I enjoy. App is also very great especially the search bar which will find you anything. I’m also a fan of paying methods, very trustworthy and suitable. I do not like how I can’t communicate with owners of shops but it’s okay. Overall I definitely recommend for fast fashion lovers and people who can never find clothes they like in stores or on other apps.",2021-02-05 02:27:10,Lilys chtehuskies
299,Good but be careful,False,4,"There’s a bunch of items on here and it’s amazing. A lot of people complain about the shipping and delivery but honestly it’s not that bad. At most items will be delivered in a month. The fastest would be about two weeks (that’s when my usual delivery comes **note 9/10 times I pay for tracking shipping which is $1-3 it’s better to do that than worry if it’ll come). 

The site is good, but again be careful because my card gives me warnings when I pay for every transaction on here so pay attention to that.

 DONT ever send your info to the app ( this one time they asked me to verify my info by sending a picture of my ID and credit card ). If you must verify your card, contact your bank before doing anything else. 

I recommend purchasing on the app ( here ) than the desktop website because you get a smaller discount ( by a few cents ) and you also get to play games to receive coins that you can redeem for items when you have enough. It’s a good site, just be careful and make sure the item you are purchasing has an option to choose tracked shipping and reviews. Please also leave reviews on items  to help others!",2020-11-02 20:30:40,user of aliexpress for 3 years
300,😍,False,5,I’ve been shopping on here for nail art/ supplies and I LOVE this site. I find so many things that I’ve seen other places for a fraction of the price. I don’t know if I’ve just been really lucky with the items I’ve chose to order but I haven’t been disappointed with a single item and I’ve made over 30 purchases totaling around 90 items. Some are still on the way but the shipping time even surprised me on some things. I got something in the mail yesterday that only took 12 days to get to me where I was honestly expecting 1-2 months! I think the key is to manage your expectations. I buy small things that can hardly go wrong maybe don’t try to buy things such as electronics or clothes,2019-11-06 15:51:32,saa😍😍😍
301,My favorite shopping app,False,5,"Definitely read all or most reviews before buying anything but other than that there’s such great deals and products. I rarely ever shop at other stores because they have practically everything I want/need right here and for SUCH A LOW PRICE, usually waaaay lower than other stores for almost, if not the exact same or occasionally better, quality. I would say though, if you are not willing to wait a couple weeks/month/ sometimes two months to receive your item(s) then do not shop here. Other than that, search your hearts desires and chances are AliExpress will have it (and most likely less expensive than anywhere else you might find it.)",2019-04-12 07:24:26,mirravee
302,The Leading Shopping App,False,5,"So far I've had no problems with this App. This is my Go-to App. The 2nd most visited App in my phone after WhatsApp 🙂 tells you how addictive this App can be. The App is user friendly and well structured and they keep things very engaging with free stuffs, games, coupons, flash deals etc.. I love this App because I'm always discovering new products with the App. The prices are absolutely fantastic and they ship to many other countries than any other shopping App. You can find almost any product you wish and if you are not careful, you may spend your entire day scrolling through the different varieties because they are just so many of them. 
This is the leading shopping app in my opinion.",2018-05-24 19:56:47,BConero
303,Good app but needs a lowest price with shipping included search,False,4,"Search should account for shipping cost, sometimes I want to find the cheapest item without scrolling through 30 of the same thing.  Also, items that have multiple selections with a bait item that is very cheap should have a listing rating or reporting option so that the listing should have poor exposure if it is not representing the correct price of the item in the thumbnail picture.  An example of this would be if I’m looking for potholders and a nice full hand version is displayed as $2, but upon opening the ad, I discover that the one I saw is really $12 and if I select a finger sized pot holder, I can get it for $2.  It’s deceptive and makes shopping on Ali and Eby less enjoyable than other sites and services.",2019-01-13 02:21:29,gfx260
304,Love this site!,False,5,"I have been using this site for over five years & have purchased over 200 items. Out of 200 maybe 2-3 items were sized much smaller than anticipated. Always great quality, all Seller’s have great communication with you. I would feel guilty using a coupon because things are so inexpensive but coupons are always offered. I literally purchase 2-5 times every month. The highlight of my day is checking for Ali packages! I even turned my mail carrier on to the site because out of curiosity she asked what was in all the little packages & then I showed her!! She was amazed at the quality & prices. Unique gifts for so little money.",2022-01-31 17:30:16,Lunas parents
305,Better than online browsers,False,5,"Most functions are easier to use here than on a computer. For instance liking products and logging on, onto the computer, constantly asks for capache codes. I don’t like using the browser version at all. This app is easy to browse and navigate. One downside: finding clothing sizes. Sometimes a store will post sizes in the link but other times it’s difficult or impossible to view so you have to look on a computer. You also can’t zoom into pictures or always see what other options look like because the picture is only a few mm long. But I’d rather use this than the computer",2021-11-16 21:12:25,Zanny725
306,AliExpress Protects Sellers First.,False,1,"I’ve been on the app, but small stuff. It’s all lower quality for the most part and while the selection is large it’s mostly all duplicate stuff. I finally went for a if ticket phone. Everything worked fine. I decided to get another one but the seller I used before didn’t have them anymore. So I went to another one. They sent me a phone what appears close but was clearly counter fit. The IMEI was even from a different model phone. I opened a dispute and after the seller failed to respond in time is was moved up to AliExpress to make a decision. They said you can have a $15 refund or return for $152 refund. I accepted full refund/return. It didn’t matter, AliExpress sided with the seller, said “it’s not counterfeit” and gave me a $15 refund closing close my dispute. The seller refuses to talk to be about return, AliExpress just says “you agreed” Now I am out $137 and have a pile of parts.",2021-12-29 23:10:18,Ghost card
307,Fun app and good products,False,5,"I enjoy scrolling through the items for sale and have found some great deals. I recommend checking the seller’s ratings before purchasing as some have good prices but bad reviews and you may end up receiving the item in bad condition, over 3 months after purchasing, or not at all. The AliExpress site will help you if you have a dispute with a seller on their app. In fact, one seller wanted to give me credit for an item I purchased from them but never received when I asked for a refund and the AliExpress app stepped in and ORDERED the seller to give me the refund. The items do take awhile to arrive, 2 months on average for me. I enjoy perusing the things for sale and I like the app.",2020-04-03 21:01:42,rny938
308,Disappointed from client service,False,2,I tried to contact client service many times i didn’t find a solution for my problem very disappointed... honestly from 3 years till now i bought hundreds articles and really i was happy it’s true than some times i received cheap quality but in the same time it was cheap .....but the last orders i tried to order the recommended articles i ordered a dress from missord i didn’t receive it i contacted the seller he said it’s in the local post office i went there they said they don’t receive the dress i re contacted the seller he didn’t do any thing no dress and no refund !!!!!!!!!!!!! So i tried to contact the client service there is only  a robot who answers the question and he wasn’t able to find a solution for me .....for me i decided not order anything more until they find a solution !!!,2021-02-28 07:40:15,ttttttthhm
309,H3 Led headlight bulbs,False,1,"It’s hard to give anything but a 1 star for now. I purchased H3 Led headlight bulbs from a Facebook seller on January 2, the order wasn’t shipped until the 7th and I received them Jan 16.  They weren’t plug and play as described and the instructions had images that didn’t pertain to the situation. Also the instructions have pictures with optional sized flanges if needed. 
 Now it gets worse. Since they didn’t fit rig by ht away, I looked for manufacturer label on the box or identification of any kind so I can see the recommended installation. Since there was no way to identify, I messaged the seller for info and he said to take it to a mechanic!! I replied, I am a mechanic, now where’s the instructions and What company makes these ? So I google the name and it leads me to a website where it’s difficult to get any information. I couldn’t find a phone number to call, or information about Led headlight bulbs that don’t fit.",2021-01-24 21:48:18,zztupper
310,I LOVE ALIEXPRESS!!,False,5,"I have purchased many, many, MANY items from AliExpress and I’m happy with 97% what I’ve received....sometimes blown away by how unexpectedly cute something is!! Just today, I received my adorable little toilet brush, that looks like a giant red cherry with a stem. It’s the little a things :)
AliExpress is also a great place to shop for Christmas! Many items are not available in the US...stationary, washi tape, Korean skin care, household tools, etc. 
Read reviews! If a seller does not have reviews available for a product, this is your first clue, that it might not be as advertised. If all the reviews seem too “perfect”, that’s your second clue. I buy from sellers with good reviews and a lot of actual product photos from customers!",2019-11-07 02:59:50,IronMaven73
311,Unbeatable prices,False,5,"Now I will say the shipping takes a long time. Some of the items I’ve ordered was exactly like was advertised, but some items I’ve gotten was extremely small but was portrayed as normal size on the listing. For the price though it’s not even a big deal. I just get on the app and find the right size I need. I will say that they need a better way to communicate with sellers and even their support. You have to go through a million steps just to get to send a email to support for answers that aren’t prompt when you contact them. Hope all of you enjoy the stuff like I do. I know I but at least 3 things a week 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♀️",2022-03-24 11:49:46,jeann'e
312,Carelessness of aliExpress and poor tracking service,False,3,"I m a member of aliExpress for nearly one year suffering a lot about getting my items I bought. There tracking system is so poor that can only track the chaineese part upto airport. There is no supervision of aliExpress over the goods during transit especially on Bangladesh part. I bought lot of things but missed two of my items. When I asked aliExpress, they suggested to open dispute and to come to compromise between me seller to share the price. They never tried to find out where the item was lost. My two items are in transit do near two months. All the time aliExpress is suggesting me to open a dispute with out any inquiry where the material is. I will say goodbye to aliExpress after receiving those two items.",2022-05-22 06:14:18,Prof. Md.

313,Way better than Wish,False,5,"What I like about Aliexpress is that you’re able to read reviews and see pictures of products that others have received! That way I can see how accurate the product is, and I don’t just get surprised by whatever shows up (unlike Wish). The only thing that I don’t like is that the discounts and coupons don’t save you much money, however the products are already quite inexpensive so that doesn’t matter! I also really like how you can picture search, and I use it to find similar items with better ratings all the time!! I definitely recommend this app, especially if you cosplay!!!!",2021-01-06 12:50:12,Juliahxu
314,Good except for the scams,False,4,"So far I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the products I’ve ordered and how fast they got to me. Some sellers are scammers however, and some customers are just so dumb they fall for it. I saw one person leaving a review on an iPhone X that they bought. They were angry it was a fake. I mean seriously, what else were they expecting? Only buy electronics from the original seller, it’s just that simple. There’s also quite a lot it bots in comment sections. Also, they have 18+ products and the stuff isn’t like restricted or anything (or at least I don’t know if it is since I can see it and I am over 18). Basically, don’t buy expensive electronics from here and you should be fine.",2021-01-21 14:12:46,kanate_ib
315,It’s a blessing in a simple click,False,5,"THIS APP IS JUST PERFECT. It has so many options including jewelry, phone cases, clothing, stickers, and more!! It’s so cheap for most items and I’ve never paid more than $5 for something on here which was a super adorable hat. Most items have free shipping so that’s always a miracle, it also lets you track all your items! and I think one of the best parts of this app is the fact that it will recommend you cheaper and better options of the items you look at and will recommend you stuff based off your purchased items which is a big helper. I trust this app a lot more than stores like wish, romwe, and shein.",2021-06-20 20:26:51,Chickennuggetpie
316,Good but needs improvement,False,4,"Can purchase many items far cheaper with far less postage. Items can take 2 weeks to 2 months to arrive. Tracking information Could be improved. On my previous review I complained because when they had to refund you for an item that was lost they would never refund you the tax but they are doing that now. The only problem with the app now is when you confirm that you have received an item it will say something like, you have received your item quite a while ago please leave us feedback. I always confirm receipt of the day I receive it so it’s not like I have really had it quite a while and they need to change their wording.",2020-12-31 19:31:38,SJLeite
317,Great and Easy to Use,False,4,"Everything is so much cheaper on AliExpress than Wish or any other stores that are likely just reselling their products. All issues are taken care of quick if there is a problem with the item or if it doesn’t show. Items can be hit or misses, but if you use your best judgement and pay attention to reviews on there, you’re good to go. 

Just don’t bother with the daily entries for winning “free” items. I actually won one of the items and instead of free they put the full price of the item into the shipping of it which I was still expected to pay. Not sure if it’s the same for all items of if that specific seller was doing that, but that was my only experience with that section of the website.",2020-07-01 00:28:21,Kay0kay
318,TIP:,False,4,"aliexpress is sketchy in its ways. It has sellers that are legit & also sellers that are frauds. Dealing with aliexpress is a gamble & my advice is to NEVER purchase anything from this app that looks too good to be true. Yes, the products are cheap, but if you can’t afford to buy the legit product in stores, dont go to this app as a plan B. Many of yall are dropping hundreds or even thousands of dollars just to get scammed bc yall are resorting to a cheap app that is sketchy to get your product. You get what you pay for. If u want to gamble your hard earned money, then thats on you, resort to buying items here that are not much of value. For me, i buy supplies in which ive never had a problem with bc i spend probably $10 max.  Dont buy any name branded items here unless you want your money scammed",2018-09-28 22:02:33,✨P E Y T O N✨
319,Scam!!,False,1,"Order two items from two different seller both did not arrive and unable to get a refund. Once the order is complete and it will send you the tracking number to track the items but I found out that the seller did not use the address in my profile. You think that your item is getting deliver but it will go to a wrong address and it will return to sender. It will show that the item is delivered even I did not receive the items. I checked with the courier the address used is wrong and they cannot change it. If you message the seller they will insist that they use the right address even after checking it with courrier that the address use is different from what you have on the profile. It happens to both items I bought. Sellers Paweinuo official store and Kanghe 88 store.

320,90% accurate,False,5,"I’ve received all but one of my orders through alibaba. The quality of the products are great and you cannot find the same things for a better price anywhere else. I bought a pair of retro ones Jordan’s for half the price stock x was charging. I brought them to get authenticated and they are 100% real. Shipping is usually very cheap if not free and even though it takes a while, you can track it’s every move. I only had one issue with a pair of sneakers that I never received and the store never bothered to respond to me at all. I put in a dispute and am currently waiting for my refund. Buy from alibaba and you won’t be sorry.",2021-05-20 15:08:11,EmoDollar$$
321,Way better than Wish,False,5,Iv been using The AliExpress app for a little while now and I love it. The minor problems I’ve had either the seller or AliExpress have fixed promptly. Once you start clicking on stuff from store to store I had to keep hitting the back button to get back to the main search screen. I didn’t realize that the home icon was hidden in a sub menu. That should be clearly marked so people know. It took me a couple months to figure that out. Maybe I’m just dumb? Anyways it’s really easy to find stuff aT great deals and easy to navigate within the different store. I use to order my Chinese stuff on eBay and wish. Not any more!! There is so much stuff to discover in the app,2019-12-23 11:58:11,the bville butcher
322,Long Time Customer,False,5,"This is one wholesale site that when you buy something, it’s exactly what you get.  I think their best products are jewelry and shoes.  This site is not like others that promote low prices and then charge you a ridiculous fee for shipping.  In fact, most of the sellers offer free shipping with reasonably priced goods.  If you have to return or dispute an item, the process is relatively simple and easy.  Also, finding items that you want using their photo search is fantastic!  You will find amazing prices on items in stores that are over priced.  Just make sure to give yourself enough time for delivery.  It can take a few weeks sometimes, but totally worth the wait!",2018-06-19 00:24:16,bethHSH
323,Needs Fixing,False,4,"I don’t usually do reviews but I use AiExpress a lot & some of the bugs have started to annoy me. 

The first is the shopping bag. Now it lets you continually add items to the bag but only 60 show and the others will appear only when you delete some of the 60 that show. I’d rather it go back to the 99 items and not let you add any more rather than to add many items & they reappear after some are deleted.

When paying for orders the payment screen just loads & loads so I didn’t know if I placed an order & was timid to hit the close button because I didn’t want my card to be charged twice. 

Adding the tax to items may have been required by law but this steers me away from making purchases. Maybe have the taxes included in the price of the items so we won’t be surprised when going to the order confirmation screen. Or, provide more discounts for the items. 

The tracking information doesn’t show the actual status any more for most of my orders. I don’t want to have to go to the actual sites to track the packages & see the status when the app has provided the status of the tracking in the past. 

PLEASE FIX!",2019-09-09 13:44:29,Tyyy.😘😘😘
324,Really good,False,5,"I was a bit confused when I first saw the app I thought it would just be like another scam app , but I’ve never had a problem and I’ve had the app over a year everything I’ve ordered came in perfect. And you should really look at the reviews before you buy some thing I see some people complain about not getting what they ordered. But if you look at the reviews especially the ones with the photos and if it’s true to the image they have then it’s probably gonna be the same for you the only thing about this app is it takes forever to ship but I think it’s worth it with the good deals you get.",2022-01-29 01:04:43,Yuki ho😏😏😏
325,Love it or hate it,False,2,I really want to say I love this app but I can’t honestly say that. There are plenty of food merchants and customer service agents and I’ve gotten some great stuff and great deals. Shoot it doesn’t even take as much time as Wish or as long as they say to get your order half the time. When it’s bad though it’s bad. AliExpress might think they are giving good customer service but they just don’t. I’ve asked serval times just to be heard about a recent disaster situation that they had multiple opportunities to smooth out but they have failed miserably. Sad but unfortunately that’s the new way and so I don’t buy like I used to and I ask the hard questions and when I get no answers or bad excuses I just don’t buy. I give up on expecting much here. I think this is why so many people fear buying this way.,2022-08-22 08:15:38,J0pinion
326,Pros and cons,False,5,AliExpress is a great place to buy anything I normally buy a lot of hair on here normally my experience has been good with them but if you buy something on here be careful because the seller will knowingly know they sent you something all jacked up with bad reviews and bad quality and when you want your money back they literally will fight your dispute also they use different pics that make you think their products are just like that in the pic but it really don’t be anything like the pic oh also really read the reviews because when something is messed up that’s probably really how their true product is,2021-10-27 13:55:58,Saggy87

I will, upon receipt, return by post the charging plug you accidentally sent to me with the hearing aid. i am ordering 2 more hearing aids today and am hoping you will send the correct charging plug that I can use here in the USA. i am extremely please with the hearing aids I ordered  from you.

328,I AM ANGRY,False,1,"I had high hopes for aliexpress. I was even more excited to learn that one of my favorite companies sold products on the website. Or as it seemed so. I made a purchase with four individual items and only received two of them in the mail. I was hoping the other two would come later but they never did. The seller has ignored all my attempts at speaking to them to fix this. I tried reaching out the aliexpress, I opened a dispute on the two products and they closed it without refund because I was unable to provide evidence. I APOLOGIZE for not knowing how to provide evidence for this. I would much rather like to just receive the product. But seeing as the seller won’t contact me back I was looking for a refund. With no success. I am very disappointed with the seller and aliexpress’s customer service. Did they even try contacting the seller? I will never be using aliexpress again.",2021-05-04 20:46:51,ryanhatesaliexpress
329,It’s great! But just one tiny problem,False,4,I love Ali express! I can find thing I want for a cheaper price..or so I thought. Even though it looks cheap when you check the prices also make sure to check the shipping. Because when I went on cart and put the stuff I wanted it was really expensive. There was this 5 dollar thing that I saw and when I put that in the cart and checked the price with my other stuff it ended being $7 which was crazy but it was shipping. So to make this app better maybe take the shipping price down a bit! But overall there are things that are free shipping! I recommend it if you don’t have a lot of money and you don’t want to buy a 100 dollar thing,2021-02-18 20:21:36,urnfybryfd
330,I am addicted to this app!,False,5,"This app was introduced to me by my way friend as a great place to find diamond paintings.  I have since heard from other diamond painting enthusiasts that AliExpreas is THE PREMIER place to go to for diamond paintings as well as accessories for DPs.  I won't go anywhere else!!!  But there are many other great products here as well!!!

I keep this app on my phone on my easy access screen and check here for anything I am looking first when shopping online.  And only here for my obsessive hobby, diamond paintings!!!  AliExpress has the best sellers and they stand behind what they allow to be sellers and what is sold in their site.  You cannot beat this site for the quality, prices, and service!

I love this place ❤️",2019-03-07 19:57:47,Jolie1251969
331,Honest review,False,4,"I have used this site and app for a while now to order hair, clothes, shoes, and eyelashes. It is a trusted site if an item takes to long to send or you never recieved an item you can make a dispute and they will refund you the money. Only problem is some items may take months to arrive but they will come so anything you are ordering for an event please consider that fact. Many of the items are from out the country so thats why shipping takes is a while. Clothes and shoes are about the same quality you would buy clothes from forever 21, fashionnova, and other boutique stores. For the price i feel this sit is wonderful really if you are trying to start your own business like selling hair, eyelashes, lip gloss, clothes or shoes.",2020-05-08 10:36:05,dvaldezjones

Majority of the stuff they sell on this app have free shipping which is amazing and all the sellers communicate very well !  Majority or items also have a 30-60day refund policy ! This app even has raffles to give away free stuff ! I’ve been using AliExpress for about 3-4 years now and I have no complaints! As long as you look for real reviews and photos before ordering something , you’ll be safe ! I shop through this app maybe more than 15 times a week ! You can get everything from clothes to pet supplies and even tools ! if you’re on the edge about downloading this app, take it from me and just do it !",2020-05-21 07:38:15,meeer10
333,Great as long as seller sends right product,False,3,"I’ve been buying from sellers on AliExpress for about 3 years now with great success.   However, I just recently received a product that was NOT what I ordered, and had to “open a dispute” to get my money back.   Never mind asking for the correct product to be sent.  The seller was non-responsive and so far, the dispute has not been resolved.  It has been over 30 days and I just want my money back!!!  The dispute process is cumbersome and confusing, and I feel there’s really no guarantee that every seller is honest.   I don’t know if I will ever see my refund, and I’m thinking of deleting the app because communication is not easy with AliExpress.   Just beware that everything is great if you’re dealing with competent sellers, but if you have the misfortune of getting otherwise, good luck",2019-01-03 11:44:19,Luprit

It’s a FAQ list of answers. I had a problem with a product. I submitted proof that it was stained with ink. Opened dispute and it was determined that I should return the product and get my money back. The problem was that shipment was $26 and the product cost $32. Not reasonable for me to loose on a defective product. After dispute verdict is reached they should allow each party to communicate and explain if disagree. Also, recently I returned some items and sent an email notifying about the tracking number yet still confusion and money was released to the seller even though product was returned.",2021-11-29 20:01:07,PatFull27
335,Not too many complaints,False,4,"I love the fact that AliExpress has almost everything that I want/need. There’s not one thing that I have searched for and they’ve not had it. I love that! I love the prices, because they are not too pricey and I can afford everything that I search for. I love how they include in the description what year the item was “hot” or when they were made. The size of the clothes are, in most cases, accurate and fit perfect! I have no problems, sometimes, with getting in contact with the sellers. The reason I say sometimes is because they don’t always get back to me. My only real complaint is the shipping time! I’ve had to wait MONTHS for my orders to be shipped out to me.",2021-06-18 05:02:19,Princess Triceyy

And the shipment toke weeks to come, so I forgot about checking the tracking # for the packages. When I tracked it, I found out my package is lost. So i tried to find a number to call customer service and there’s no number. You could only leave a massage under your order. And they send me in Automatic message that said “order has been automatically confirmed by the system because no action received from the buyer within the buyer protection time.” You got to be kidding me there shouldn’t be a time limit, I bought a product that I didn’t receive and and shipping comes weeks to a month to come.

337,Cheapest internet shopping,False,3,"AliExpress is where you can find the cheapest stuff on the web. But living in the USA, things usually take 1 1/2 -2 months to arrive. Also always purchase things from a company with higher ratings. It will only be a couple of dollars difference, but will mean a lot if anything happens to your order. I had ordered from a company called SDJZT Store for a chair green screen background. It broke the day I received it. I opened a dispute with the company and it dragged on forever. I told them I was not going to give them a bad review if they had fixed things. SDJZT Store just dragged and played me along until it was too late to give the review. With companies that have higher reviews, they will refund and send you missing parts immediately.",2021-08-03 16:37:34,DjGGstyle
338,Good but be warned...,False,4,Aliexpress is a great way to shop if you have the patience for it. If you arent a stickler for name brands or high end products this is a great way to buy mass amounts of products for an affordable price. You may or may not have heard but shopping from this site often leads to long wait time as the orders typically take one month to arrive. Personally I dont mind it as im fine if i plan ahead. BUT BE WARNED: if your order doesnt arrive after 3 months it most likely will never arrive YET FOR SOME ODD REASON the app will AUTOMATICALLY confirm the arrival of your order for you! You should definitely communicate with the store of whom you ordered from to address this issue if you’ve been waiting for more than 2 months,2020-11-20 00:25:35,Pyro_leo

What?! That is literally the opposite of helpful and the literal opposite of making sense! The item my son was most excited about was a a pair of what he called ‘black airpods’. Arrived BROKEN. Don’t charge. Don’t connect. Don’t play music. After weeks now of conversing with the store and alibaba directly who will “personally handle my complaint and insure a resolution everyone is happy with “ after uploading a video for proof of them not working they told me “on video u didn’t charge long enough “ offered me $0 refund. Do u want a 6 hour long video of sitting on charger? I’m not a moron. All this aggression now they say final offer is I send back on my dime with tracking number which will cost MORE than item is worth then they will refund. GARBAGE. Enormous Waste of time, money and aggression!!!",2020-07-21 13:44:54,JesParker
340,Awesome app!  Fantastic Deals!,False,5,"AliExpress provides outstanding price reductions due to their BtoB and BtoC business model. I would highly recommend. Deliveries started about 8-9 days later and they continue. It has been more than two weeks and I believe there are a few more items to be delivered 

I selected US distribution when it was available but most of the deliveries have shipped from China. One device that would typically retail for $400 and was on sale for $218 had little protection but it was in a metal briefcase.

 A large envelope of Needles that were required for this device were sent without any padding by a different seller. Hopefully, there won’t be any issues when I begin using them.",2019-09-15 21:46:27,AMBDC
341,Do not buy from these vendors,False,1,"This company does not care what these vendors do to you. Their customer service is a JOKE! It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to talk to an actual person. Their chat bot EVA just asks the same unrelated questions over and over and over. Their dispute process takes so long, the $50 u lost to a scam seller just ain’t worth it anymore. My entire account has just disappeared and nobody can tell me why, and I’ve only got ahold of an actual human being ONE TIME, ever. I filed a complaint with the BBB but I know that won’t have any effect. Shop in America. Shipping from China takes months as of right now.  But they won’t tell u that u til after they have your money. Also, all the product reviews are fake. U can tell when it says the reviewer is from USA but uses clearly broken English like a Chinese person would. Just scammers left and right. Don’t waste your time or money.

 Covid-19 had at lot to do with this, but I will not be ordering anything else no time soon until they can start making better progress in delivering and making sure that we are able to track our products in a proper fashion.

The items range in every category so there is always something you may be looking for on the site. It works seamlessly and is straight forward to use. The perks you get for using the app are cool as well! The points and coins you accrue for getting stuff and completing tasks can be put towards coupons on items or on your total order to save even more on items you find!

344,Great,False,4,"I've used aliexpress for about 4 years now. Very nice prices. Prices used to be way lower 4 years ago but I still can't argue, prices are excellent but sellers don't speak a lot of English so the communication might be off a little bit. But they work with you, and most will give you great deals, especially if it's a new seller. I recommend if you have your own retail business, this should definitely be your vendor. It's cheap and good quality depending on the line of work you do. I will however say if you’re buying multiple products from sellers on AliExpress sometimes they will mess up your order and there’s no going back. I messaged one seller and told them I received the wrong product and they responded with a sad emoji. So ya there’s no going back xD",2019-03-25 21:00:11,Eleanorisraeli

You’re probably wondering why I’m giving a 4 star and saying this. I personally haven’t had any problems with AliExpress, however some people do tend to not get their things or get scammed but you have to leave it up to the reviews. If I see something and it doesn’t have reviews I usually find something else or take a leap and decide to get it. Their products are usually low quality and cheap but their adorable and cute. I will continue to buy from their but also be cautious of the things I tend buy and highly suggest you do the same. Thank you.",2022-08-25 16:12:49,My peen is to large

The people that you communicate with are so nice it’s a pleasure to shop at AliExpress. Thank you for allowing me to purchase items I normally wouldn’t be able to.
I have found 99% of sellers very nice and honestly present their products. It does seem like prices have gone up a tad.
When I purchase clothes made in China for myself or grandkids at a local store they fit. But when I order through AliExpress they are way too small. That’s sad because I would order a lot if the sizes were right. (I even order several sizes larger, but they are still small).",2019-12-17 23:04:33,notheirnot

It’s only $16 and some change but thats MY MONEY and I have two other packages that were done the same way. I issue a dispute (w a pic of invoice showing item returned) and yaw STILL KEPT MY MONEY EVEN THOUGH YOUR PROPERTY WAS RETURNED TO SENDER BY THE POST OFFICE . I said at least send me the package

349,Can’t Use Select Coupons!,False,1,"So in general, I like this app. I shop on it all the time, and it is the best way to buy off of AliExpress. But it has a big glitch that makes me really mad today. I can’t use any of my select coupons! I have $18 in select coupons, and none of them show up in checkout. I’m buying an item from a seller that accepts the select coupons and I’m spending more than the required amount, but no select coupons in the checkout. Even more frustrating, is that the select coupons come up just fine on that same order on the PC website version. Only the order is more expensive off of the website. So, yeah, not happy... The other glitch is that when leaving feedback, if you try to leave too much the app kicks you out. I ordered a number of little things from a seller and couldn’t leave feedback through the app for this reason. Please fix it.",2019-11-11 15:41:05,SilverStar-Burst
350,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,False,1,"I ordered two pair of shoes from Cuculus Saturatus , but I never received them. It said shoes were delivered to mailbox, but shoes won’t fit in our mailbox. I contacted AliExpress to check on status of shoes because they said they were delivered. Well, I’ve been getting the run arounds and evidently they have a robot responding to your messages. It says upload evidence.. How can you upload evidence if you don’t have the merchandise. I uploaded the pictures from our house camera to show the day the shoes were supposedly delivered the mail carrier was only at our mailbox for 5 seconds. So our mail carrier is a superhero, they can put mail shove 2 pair of shoes in mailbox in 5 seconds. After going back in forth with AliExpress CUCULUS SATURATUS they said “NO REFUND!!  If you like being robbed, this is exactly where you should shop!! Will never shop from you again. In my robotic remarks: May your sales plummeted!!!!

351,Lateness,False,1,"I bought a dress and I received it late. I needed it for a special occasion. since it arrived late, I had to use another dress. The seller lasted too many days and I even asked him to cancel the order because I didn’t have the option to do it. The seller didn’t cancel and send the order anyways. After I got the dress, I applied to return it. The seller lasted 2 or 3 days to respond and to accept my return. By the time, I was out of town time, and I only have 9 days left to send the dress. The seller wanted me to pay for the return shipping and trying to negotiate for the seller to pay the shipping the time expired. So, I’m stock with a dress I can’t use and my money was wasted. Before you buy in AliExpress, make you you read every description the seller add to item and take screenshot just in case you need to appeal to not loose your money because you can’t return.",2022-10-25 12:45:49,Rojas 🤦🏽‍♀️
352,Deceptive advertising in a lot of the shops.,False,3,It’s a shame that they don’t know what bait and switch is supposedly. They advertise something at 799 but when you go to look at it and to buy it when you find out is only one piece is for 799 if you want the whole thing then it’s $30. I’ve mentioned it on several different things that I’ve seen on the site and they act like they don’t know what you’re talking about. It’s disappointing but to be expected for the prices that you’re paying and all the quality is very poor. So far this is my first time ordering with them and I’ve ordered quite a bit of things and you’ll see that my reviews so far are mediocre. Sorry wish it was better get it wish it was better,2022-10-20 07:21:23,avghostofmany
353,Drone I ordered,False,2,Seller took almost 10 days to ship after ordering on August 18.  I just received my item on September 20 every other item I ordered was delivery within 10 to 14 days.  Last day of summer was  the day the drone arrived so I feel very dissatisfied.  I contacted the seller like 10 days ago because it said my item would be delivered on September 8 and I never received anything or show updated tracking information.  So he provided a updated tracking info link and said don’t worry your item is coming. I ordered other items that same day and all those items was delivered before September 8 so you how I feel about ordering in the future this seller.  I know it not Ali express fault but you need to communicate with your seller to prevent this from being a problem in the future.  Thanks,2022-09-24 18:43:37,Mrblender47
354,It’s a great app,False,5,I have been purchasing from AliExpress for about 3 years. I did not like the app when it first came out because it was so different than shopping from their full website. But I have come to love this app. They have put a lot of work into it and now it’s pretty great. It provides all the information I could want on any item I choose. It’s so much easier now to order and leave feedback. It’s easy to check status of orders and keeps record of all orders so that if I want to repeat buy something I can look for it in previous orders. AliExpress is a great website and now they have an app to match.,2021-10-13 22:26:07,Laniegirl63
355,iPad app and website need a lot of work.,False,3,"Since my last review was deleted right as I finished writing I’ll keep this short. The iPad app is horrible and the website is a (not very funny) joke. For some reason they expect you do do all your shopping through your iPhone, which I guess is something that people actually do but I personally find it quite restrictive. If this were a small indie outfit this would be acceptable, but there are so many bugs with both the website and the iPad app that I don’t really find forgivable. They have plenty of money to throw at these issues and they simply choose not to. 3 stars only because I find it to be such a useful app to connect directly with manufacturers despite the myriad of issues.",2022-06-13 16:12:54,Pyk
356,Unreliable and a Money Gamble,False,1,"I never received most of my items and never got most of my money back after filing disputes with AliExpress. USPS could not handle delivering my electric cords and other chargers, etcetera and trashed them in less than a week because USPS said that the box said ""perishable"". By the time the combined package comes to America, there are too many language differences that lead to me losing nearly $50 in non-perishable items. The first orders I made, I received at home fine and was happy. Most of my later orders were unknowingly and unwontedly ""combined"" and sent to the local post office, instead of my same home address that did not change. All in all, it's a broken system with too many unreliable parts and people who can't communicate with each other successfully. Save your money, time, and frustration. Do not do business with AliExpress or Alibaba.",2022-01-08 17:57:03,Remember That Guy?
357,Keeps me looking bougie,False,5,"There is absolutely any type of clothing that you could possibly buy and for 10% of what they retail for in stores. I️ get more compliments on my clothing from here than what I️ buy at my local branded stores. Apart from clothes, there is so many electronics and arts and crafts things which work great!!! I️ bought UV nail lamps which are amazing and stickers and such. This app is just wonderful!!! HOWEVER! always look into things that have picture reviews or good store reviews before purchasing for like any other online space, the store could be fraud or the product could look nothing like the how it was advertised.",2021-03-01 19:36:39,Escuvan1782
358,Get what you pay for-DO NOT RECCOMMEND,False,1,I’ve ordered a few things off of this app but after my recent order I’m deleting my account. The sellers I contacted didn’t respond to any of my messages except for the seller who sold me the earrings I ordered.... that never came. I ordered these earrings in May and when I got the package it was completely different from what I ordered. I messaged the seller and they said they didn’t even sell the item?? I got what looks like a septum ring? For the prices I or course expected the to be quite cheap in material which they were. I was disappointed with a necklace set I ordered since it didn’t come with each necklaces separately clasped. I also ordered T-shirts in a size medium and they fit like an xsmall. I ordered something for my friend who just graduated and they gave me a refund since apparently the seller didn’t ship it out in time? Lots of questionable things about this app. Do NOT recommend,2020-08-08 04:24:18,Skittles_372
359,DO NOT USE,False,1,"I made the mistake of disregarding other reviews like this. This company does not care about the customers. I have been waiting on a package for 2 months. The tracking states 2 “attempted deliveries” that never happened. The package has been shipped back to the manufacturer and they still won’t refund me my money. The stores customer services is also lacking. I ordered from a store called SHALLOW L-O-V-E STORE and the communication is rare and you can’t understand what they are trying to communicate. They have told me that they will give a refund when they receive the product, but the tracking shows that they already have. All I get from the company is “Be Patient” and “Don’t worry” and they take days to reply to a message. Save yourself the money and hassle and don’t use this app. You may have to spend more money elsewhere but at least you’ll get a better product and save yourself the trouble.",2019-12-20 06:01:53,Lauren1199
360,Huge fan!,False,5,"I love Ali-Expess!  The app is very convenient and extremely reliable.  However, I want more favorites lists!!!  I have used all of mine and it’s not enough with the massive variety of products available!  Particularly because I shop for myself and my business.  Why limit it when sellers will just sell more!   I also think the shipping costs should be provided as a single line item and not per item in checkout.  My guess is both sellers & and Ali-Express are losing out on shipping upgrade revenues because you are basically penalized if you purchase a lot of items and want to pay more for faster shipping.  Otherwise, it’s a fabulous!!!  The app itself is excellent!",2019-11-21 03:02:56,Joyous Mom
361,AliExpress = AWESOMENESS,False,5,I have ordered several items on AliExpress site and I can honestly tell you that the folks at AliExpress have your back if you experience a bad sell from any of their vendors.  Just keep documentation of your messages between you and the vendor so that AliExpress can have proof to take back to that vendor and get things straightened out.  I have only had 1 such experience and AliExpress resolved it very quickly.  AliExpress has awesome vendors.  Always look for vendor rating and customer reviews and those things will tell you if that vendor is worthy of you spending your money with them.  I hope this information helps everyone to feel comfortable ordering through AliExpress.,2019-10-23 16:34:17,DP63356
362,Fabulous app,False,5,"EXTREMELY easy to use; tons of items to choose from, and the app is FULLY featured. I appreciate the tracking capability, how easy it is to leave feedback and photos, and how easy it is to communicate with seller. I also appreciate seeing other user reviews and their pictures. IMHO, this is THE best app i have—for any purpose—bar none. Completely user-friendly, yet jam packed with options. It lacks absolutely nothing. As far as the products go, I have purchased many many items from AliExpress and have NEVER been disappointed, EVER. And no one can beat the prices. BRAVO Ali express; well done! I have spread the word.",2022-06-30 23:27:24,Sydandme
363,Unsure,False,3,"I normally have a good time and normally enjoy shopping on this site. Thou recently I just had a a few company from this site, send me things things I had canceled and withdrew from my bank account leaving me in the negative. I would just warn people to be careful when buying stuff. I had canceled my orders because my friends granddaughter went on my phone and ordered stuff while I was in the bathroom. I was already online shopping on the site. When I seen what she had done, I tried canceling. But when they went through anyway. I was very upset. Because my bank account is now in the negative by -$175. The things I ordered should have only took out $130. I had only $200 in my bank account. Now I am terrified on what I’m going to do. I talked with my bank and they are going to investigate.",2019-09-15 13:08:16,LaZaira7
364,good! but...,False,3,"this app is amazing! everything is cheap and nice! I do have one problem though. so I decided to search up “anime figures” because I wanted a cute little anime doll!! I only found gross things, so continued looking for different things such as, cute clothes, supplies, mouse pads, etc. about a day later, I go back on, and in my recommended are the gross anime figures. I was disgusted. so I started letting it know that I would not like to purchase these. so I looked a bit more, and then got off. the next day, I got even MORE gross things. they weren’t even related to anime figures! there were sex toys which I did not want. it seemed like the more I said i wasn’t interested, the more there was. so at one point, I decided to delete the app overall. this was a very big problem for me counting I’m a young user, please fix this!!",2019-06-27 23:44:32,galacticchan
365,I like AliExpress but hate the lost packages,False,4,"I’ve bought a lot from this app. Mostly a good experience. Here lately though, now that things are held and small packages gathered into one larger bag for mailing I’ve received someone else’s stuff and mine was lost, I’ve not received several things at all and In one case I didn’t receive a package, I waited patiently giving the benefit of the doubt but then the seller marked it complete and I was unable to even try for a refund. Not cool obviously. So I don’t know. Have things gone downhill? Have I just picked the wrong sellers? Hopefully it’s the second and things get back to being normal. I guess 2 more chances to lose my stuff and then I’ll go elsewhere.",2022-10-13 22:14:00,StephieD2370
366,Review: Opaltrade,False,5,"I have been using Aliexpress for over a year. I had some minor mishaps at the beginning but, I have had a good experience since then. What I like about the app is my money is not released until I receive the goods and say this is what I bought. What I don’t like is when the wrong item is shipped I have to return it. I feel like you wait 3 to 4 weeks to receive an order and find out someone was not being attentive to their job and the customer has to bear the burden this could improve. I really love your prices and the swiftness in some orders and the variety of products you have gets a five star from me.",2020-12-24 18:28:47,Opaltrade
367,It's good when you're not in a rush for your items.,False,3,The app could probably benefit from a built in translator app or something as sometimes it's difficult to explain something when there's a question or issue with item.   The refunds take way too long when items are returned. Maybe a  search engine that doesn't require you to know the exact name of what you're looking for.  I mean there's times I want to search for something but don't know what it's called so I just type in the name of the type of part and where it goes on my vehicle.  Sometimes I can find what I'm look g for but more often than not I can't find what I'm looking for easily. Like today I could t ding the shock absorbers for the front forks of my scooter (TVICTOR SH-11).,2022-04-21 03:31:32,Madrob126
368,My happy place 😍,False,5,"Oh AliExpress how do I love thee, let me count the many money 💰 saving ways 😍😍😍 I spend at least most of the day and night on this app and I buy everything from bar ware to clothes and shoes for myself and my Kids! I love this website! The only thing that I DON’T like, is that you can’t add more than 100 items to the cart and that you can only create a certain amount of wish lists. They also need to do better at weeding out poor quality merchandise sellers. Also I have been having problems submitting orders for payment. Please fix that, other than these minor things, I love this app!",2022-11-21 14:19:48,RoyaltyFamous
369,Very pleased,False,5,"I have purchased 2 items from AliExpress and have been very pleased so far. I was hesitant at first to order something international but now I have no concerns. The products I have gotten have been as advertised and have cost less than anywhere else. The only downside and it is not AliExpress’s fault, it that because items have to go through customs, the wait to get something takes a while longer. It took about 3 weeks to get something but considering the cost it was fine for me. If you need something quick, AliExpress is probably not for you but other than that it is a winner!",2021-06-29 01:30:07,Iw Neese
370,Great connection to products but poor search engine,False,2,"Easy to order and great tracking service. Never regretted shopping through this.  However It is rather difficult to find what I am looking for as the search engine is poor leading to numerous related products (and some unrelated products) but most not matching the search criteria. So I find myself having to review a lot of the products and eliminate until I find what I am looking for.  Needs improvement on that. Also some sellers list multiple products under one title and when I look at it, price listed is for a part or a small piece that was grouped with the advertised product. At times I find price listing inaccurate as listed price inly available for shipping locations that do not exist. I hope these will improve.",2022-01-14 23:00:28,Canarsieman
371,Best Prices for Quality Goods,False,5,"A fantastic site for quality goods without the middle man mark up. All items come from China, so read the reviews carefully and communicate with the seller should you have any questions prior to purchasing as you can not return items purchased. I have purchased hundreds of items through AliExpress with most of what I’ve purchased I’ve been very happy with. Those items I wasn’t so happy with, if it was due to seller negligence, I have been refunded without shipping the item back. Otherwise, I just donate the items I do not wish to keep. All in all, a fun site to shop, shop, shop!",2021-03-01 02:56:55,Kikijanel
372,Better than Wish,False,5,I’ve had 0 issue with them compared to wish. No one is demanding any bank information every couple days. I get the items quicker. The items are nicer and seem to be better quality. Ie my detective pikachu from AliExpress is completely adorable vs the one from wish which kind of looked like a ditto got stuck half way and just forgot how to Pokémon. It legitimately scared my cats and was uncomfortable to look at so I threw it out. Not the first item I’ve thrown out from wish either. The only item I couldn’t use from AliExpress was a piece of clothing and you have to be well aware of the risk when it comes to their sizing vs where ever you’re from.,2019-08-01 16:39:49,KittenSneezesSn
373,don't hold your breath waiting for your refund!,False,1,"in done with this company. wish may have higher prices but your refunds are back in your account in 2 days! 3 at the most. aliexpress lets the seller decide if you should get a refund. then if they approve it then your back waiting for a long wait. if you don't receive it you have to prove you didn't. they dont. think twice before sending your hard earned money to this company. 
UPDATE:
The stores will not ship during festivals, holidays. I ordered an item Jan. 14th. Today is Feb. 8. Still no word on will it will be shipped! And not just one store. I bought some gifts shortly after the first item only 2 have shipped out of 25 plus items! I keep asking when will you ship and was told when the festival is over. I was told I was “ grumpy”. Shop here all you want but I’m finding even for the little things it’s better bought at home!",2020-02-10 01:31:53,RUA2JIAM
374,Patience is what you'll need with this app!,False,5,"If you don't mind waiting for your purchases within a month then look away. But all in fairness, what I enjoy about this app is the many things to choose from. It reminds me a virtual dollar store that you can buy many nifty things, for the ""low.""  Last but not least, even though the delivery takes within a months time-frame. I've noticed they allow combined packaging to shorten the wait! which is cool. My only advice is to try ordering stuff at the 1st of the month because then you could assume you'll get your packages, by the end of the month :)",2021-07-28 13:29:54,𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘭𝘺𝘨𝘢𝘭91
375,"Pretty good, but..",False,4,"I buy things all the time off of aliexpress, but recently I got a bad seller. They scammed me and I opened a dispute. They never responded so I won the dispute which aliexpress handled for me. I was supposed to get my money back and I waited weeks and i’m pretty sure I never received my refund. I am disappointed, but it was pretty cheap. Still, if you are going to buy on aliexpress only buy cheap things because if you don’t receive them you may not get refunded. I will check again to see if I got the refund. Make sure you order from good sellers, it was partially my fault from ordering from a seller that had 95% positive feedback. Try to order from sellers with 97% and up, and choose epacket shipping so you can track your order!",2018-07-27 23:37:01,OceanAzure
376,AliExpress supports scammer seller,False,1,"I purchased a purse over 3 months ago and never received it. Customs stopped the package and returned it to the seller. I filed a dispute to get my money back. Seller keeps sending the same message “Package is with the customs here is the tracking number…. Well that doesn’t help me and if you check the tracking it says package was returned to the seller. AliExpress proposed the solution for me to get full refund, which I accepted, but seller declined and now keeps offering various amounts ranging 10-30% of the price I paid. I keep rejecting and they proposed the next amount which is never over 30%. They are basically prolonging the time and it’s been over 3 months process. What is sad, is that AliExpress doesn’t protect its customers and continues to support a scammer. I’ve spent a lot of money with AliExpress and expect customer support not a scam! SHAME!",2022-06-23 02:01:11,BOPOHA

For all my review and tutorial equipment, I shop here. Clothes, makeup, household products, electronics, I shop here. I may be fully obsessed but, at least it’s an inexpensive habit. Cat toys and furniture all here. I redid my bathroom shopping here. I got me and my daughters bedsets and curtains, here. I can’t say enough!

378,Messy shipping system and ridiculous dispute process,False,1,"I am buying quite a lots past few years. Recently, the shipping label always incorrect as per the Tracking Information. Then package being delivered to somewhere else. But dispute has no such option of “incorrect delivery address”. Then denied my dispute due to “ a record of being delivered “.  No one care about the incorrect shipping address (not the same as my account record). Sometime, the address is not messed up poorly, only wrong Building Name and no suite #. I still have a chance to receive it with ANGERS. It all depends on how smart the delivery agent/guys. Last time, the postman told me where she delivered my 3 packages, I went personally to got them back from the greedy recipient a week later. No way to complain and no one cares. No one will trust/ buy from AliExpress anymore but merchants with very cheap items.",2021-05-29 16:05:19,Raymond Lee58
379,Beware of Sellers,False,3,I have order off of AliExpress about a total of three times. Usually I get my things within the month or two in great condition but my most recent buy from a seller has been quite frustrating. Ali express needs a better way in contacting their sellers. One of my orders didn’t make it to me and when I contacted the post office they let me know my package had the wrong address and to contact the sender. I did exactly what I told and the sender was not cooperative at all. I opened an dispute and my request was automatically invalid due to their buyer protection bull crap. I uploaded evidence and it appears it’s not being properly reviewed. There need to be a better way to contact sellers and managers of the website . I do not believe I would be ordering from this site ever again.,2020-09-24 02:57:36,GuardianAtNight

From basic utilities, to home decors, kitchen supplies, clothing, party items, electronics, tools, beauty products, toys, etc, you name it and you can find it here. You can easily choose products based on product description, product reviews and feedbacks with photos, and also seller information.

382,My fave app!,False,5,"Literally use this app every day since 2012. 
it has everything on it and at great prices! like I can buy the same dress on this website 10 times cheaper than on another website. AliExpress has everything from adorable accessories, jewelry, arts and crafts, collectible  toys (my favorite store on there atm is Pop Marts I buy way to much from them 🤭😵‍💫) 
Anyways Aliexpress will probably have everything you need ! from lighting, furniture, kitchen appliances, bathroom necessities, things for your pets… EVERYTHING! The list goes on !! I love this app Tbh I hope not everyone finds out about it because it’s my favorite secret 🪷🫧🫠",2022-05-06 01:21:22,xpuppperx
383,"Good, I guess.",False,4,"I hate that there’s multiple listings for the same item (and each listing is a different price), and I don’t like how some sellers will include an add-on item option in a listing. For example: a seller will have a listing for jeans with three different color options for $30 each and then an option for a pair of socks for $2 on the same listing. They do that so when you sort lists by price, their listing will pop up because of the $2 item, even though the $2 option is not an item you were looking for, it’s just an option on the listing. It’s annoying. But other than that, if you’re willing to search through all of the clutter, you can usually find some good deals.",2019-04-18 07:23:59,ecwhitman
384,Terrible customer service,False,2,"Due to a “violation use of coupon”. The app said if your a new user you get a free coupon which I was so at checkout I got the coupon but because my mom is a member already and I used her card I was in violation and my coupon was taken away and order canceled which isn’t right. Somebody using the same card should not be a violation or going as far as canceling a whole order that I was expecting to get for an event and not only that The refund process could take up to 20 business days which I don’t understand because it didn’t take 20days to take the money out of my account ! And after I joined live chat to have my questions answered, I kept being sent an automatic answer instead of a real answer . Coupon rules should be adjusted and customer service is just terrible all together",2018-06-30 20:36:58,Amber treasure 1146 Ambeezy
385,DONT USE,False,1,"I’ve been using this app since I was 14-15 years old. At first I used to love this app and I never had any issues with it, as I’ve grown older I’ve started to notice a lot of things with certain stores. I have been scammed multiple times off this app but multiple stores. And when I had contacted AliExpress with proof such as photos, emails, and conversations with their agents (mostly rude) and they still refuse to do anything about the stolen money from my account and the multiple packages that I had never received.I have had to contact my local police department over this matter and they are now taking it into their hands. I am 23 now and have realized that the scamming off this app is more than normal activity. 

If you want a amazing app that is almost exactly like AliExpress but have better morals I suggest Alibaba. But this app ain’t it.",2022-08-04 14:04:09,Emily Cowart
386,Better Than Wish!,False,5,"I've been using AliExpress for about 2 years(or maybe 3 I'm not sure) and the way the app is set up is easier than Wish! It's easier to talk to sellers and find better deals! All the things I've order so far come around the estimated time or earlier! The only thing that confuses me is the coins that you get after making a review on a purchase. You'll get 5 coins for doing so but I'm not sure what they're used for. Other than that everything is great! I recommend it if you want to find cute stuff for a great price!

TL;DR: good shipping time, great for broke high schoolers and better than wish",2020-12-21 04:49:44,ℂ𝕦𝕣𝕝𝕪
387,Closed my dispute (never got my package),False,1,"I opened a dispute with a seller because I never received my package, even though it said that it was delivered. AliExpress kept denying my request because I didn’t have “proof,” even though I called my local post office like they told me to and the post office had no idea where the package was.

AliExpress finally closed my dispute today and paid the seller the money. I still haven’t received my package. Upon doing some digging, I found out that my pacakage was delivered to Israel, not the U.S. (where I’m from). I took screenshots and was about to re-open my dispute when I found out that I couldn’t.

I couldn’t contact AliExpress or try to upload my proof because they’ve closed my dispute, all I can do is leave feedback for the seller. I’m really upset and I’m not using this app again. This app doesn’t protect its buyers and it shows. They don’t even have a contact where you can reach out to them. They allowed a seller to just steal my money.

FYI - I always check reviews and try to scope out who I’m going to buy from before I even place an order and this seller had great reviews and ratings. Sometimes, it’s not enough to check reviews and ratings. Scammers will find a way to steal from you.",2022-04-21 06:32:30,AhhBreezy
388,"Terrible communication, service, and quality",False,1,"I once had a positive review but most certainly had to come and change it after the numerous bad experiences I’ve had up to this point. Sellers do not communicate much even waiting weeks for some of them to answer. They are very abrupt and don’t provide much support. I can’t even begin to tell you how many times my items have gotten lost in tracking or the mail somehow, on their behalf. Sometimes, I didn’t even receive appeal for a refund, from THEIR mistake! I received 3 items I ever purchased. One was nail glue, another was little temporary tattoos, easy enough. The other was a shirt. Picture was completely different from the actual product, and the material was so thin. The graphic on the tee is already peeling, I’ve worn it TWICE! Goodbye AliExpress. For the love of god, don’t use this service! Thanks :)",2022-01-13 06:52:42,SamS56

I have 1 more order waiting to arrive. But since yesterday, whenever I tried to purchase and pay my order, it always say “Payment Failed”. Then there’s this button to select “Submit Appeal”. After you select that it will direct you to a page which requires to upload your personal id like driver’s license and credit card? Like why do you have to do that? That’s a personal thing. And for security purposes, why will I upload my credit card with all the details on it? Tried to delete the app and install it again but same is happening. If you will experience this I advise to just delete permanently the app! Not worth it to sacrifice my security!",2021-04-01 17:02:41,NebRafa
390,I love Aliexpress,False,5,"I love the app, I’ve won 2 freebie so far. The sellers are quick to please, I get exactly what I ordered like 95 % of the time. If I ever (rarely) don’t receive the item or the wrong one, they always refund me. I’ve been buying so much on here for years, I am addicted. Lol all the stuff they sell on wish or anything other online store about 90% of it is from Aliexpress, and if you do an image search for something you will find it for a lot cheaper on Aliexpress. This site is great, just remember that it’s going to take Awhile to get your stuff. Like a month or longer sometimes, it’s not the sellers fault. I recommend this app, I tell all my friends about it. 😝",2020-05-01 07:54:52,Luna NyteGlow
391,Love it!!,False,5,"Great site . Not everything comes perfect . But with the prices it’s forth it. Just make sure you read the reviews and look for pictures people personally upload in the review. And good this is, if the reviews aren’t good there are typically other sellers that sell the same thing. Depending on what you are looking at. It’s fun fun fun!! My only real cons is most things are shipped out by individual seller and at different times so you can order a bunch of different things at one time but 1 package maybe come in a week, another in 3, another in a month . But 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️ . and shipping can go as long as a 2 1/2 month so pay attention to the estimated delivery time .",2018-06-12 18:04:14,Aaliyah Sinclaire
392,I can’t complain,False,5,"I always get what I order I haven’t been super disappointed with anything I got. You really have to read the reviews before you decide what to purchase and from whom you purchase from. Look at the sellers Percentage if it’s  in the 80’s don’t do it ! And read the sellers reviews to see what customers say about their experience, reach out to sellers if you have questions, and pay attention to when an item says when it will get to you if you purchase . Shipping does take awhile but this isnt the site you order from when you need something immediately.",2022-05-05 11:25:58,gaven 20
393,Great deals,False,5,I love this app and most things I order with the proper research of reviews are accurate! Photo reviews help the most but sometimes occasionally there are sellers who post pictures of a product but the actual product is not like the picture at all but luckily they refunded me. I don’t trust ones that don’t have photo reviews yet but if you check description it can show the actual product they have. Shipping for China to USA can take a month or longer sometimes they might surprise you and it’s a bit short like 2 weeks. USA ships within 1-2 weeks within USA which is great. I love this app.,2021-04-23 12:49:58,Wealthybg
394,"Excellent prices, for the most part",False,4,"It’s a perfect site for wholesale items, and those wishing to buy large quantities of items. Due to the shipping, items can take months to come in. And on the rare occasion, there are sellers that won’t send items at all (when this happens, for the most part, customer service can help). So while there are upsides to the cheaper prices, there are certainly downside too. But overall, the app functions well. 

I would just recommend shoppers to shop consciously (don’t order something and forget about it because it might not ever come, and you’ll lose money). Also, above all else, check reviews!!!",2021-12-14 20:03:54,MadiMerlin
395,I love this app and use it a lot!,False,5,"I have been using AliExpress for over a year now. I have to say I am very pleased and satisfied with everything I have ordered.  I haven’t had any problems with the app. The problems I have had have been with a couple of dishonest sellers. But I have ordered from at least thirty or more different sellers. All but the two have been honest and courteous and very helpful if there was a problem. The other two I had to open disputes over shortages in merchandise. However AliExpress backed me and I was issued refunds. I would never reorder from those sellers. But as I said, all the other ones are awesome and do a great job. Thanks for everything AliExpress!!",2017-12-01 23:49:32,AVM103
396,Best deals possible,False,5,"Because there are so many vendors anything u find. U can type it into the search then filter free shipping because why ever pay shipping? And then sort lowest to highest and u find that product at the absolute lowest price and no shipping 
Insanely cheap

I have friends families that have started entire businesses by finding vendors to work with thru this app and they opened their own store because the prices are so amazing and it’s things that are so rare and a quantity at the moment so it’s easy to flip the merchandise to those to lazy to use the app or just don’t care but it’s a nice side hustle in itself",2022-12-01 23:57:52,LBCFIREPIE
397,Go here before Etsy,False,5,"So guys... people on Etsy go on Ali and buy stuff and then sell it on Etsy claiming it’s hand made, the funny thing is some of the stuff in Ali is in fact customized so that’s not necessarily a complete lie but just know that a lot of “top sellers” on Etsy are probably on Ali for 1/5 th the price, I still love my Etsy I just make sure it’s hand made before I buy it, I buy everything else in Ali express, I even got my PJ Harvey rid of Me hoodie there for 30$... that’s amazing!!! I received it in 3 weeks... not bad at all, they’re better than eBay with shipping. Ali has been my go to for so many weird things lately and I’m loving it.",2021-02-20 09:08:55,daniisafeminist
398,NO.,False,1,"I have NEVER been able to use this app in the three years I’ve had an account.  I signed up with ‘Log-In With Apple’, but have only been able to log in on the website.  On top of that, I’ve never even been able confirm my account (although I can still make and receive purchases) because I have never been sent any of confirmation codes (have tried over 50 times in the past three years).  This also means I don’t receive shipping/delivery updates; the only way I have information about my orders is if I constantly check the website (as opposed to receiving up-to-date app alerts).

And—to add insult to injury—I have NEVER been able to get in touch with anyone on the “support” team… just the completely useless chatbot.  No matter which option you choose as your issue, it continually reverts to the original prompt after it asks you to type your reason for contacting support.  There are literally no humans monitoring the system, and no number to call to ACTUALLY speak with someone.

Additionally, even if I were able to actually use the app, there is no landscape implementation on iPad… so that’s already a no-go for me.

My most recent order is more than likely going to be my last.",2022-08-11 01:35:11,🐯 The White Tiger
399,Need more American sizing better quality,False,3,"I live in US and often find the sizing and quality off this site is questionable. There are only a couple of sites I’ve found that is true to sizing and quality. Shoe and clothing sizing is a problem, quality of material is a problem and communication barriers is a problem. When it comes to returning merchandise forget it. It also takes forever to receive your product. The clothes on this site unique and fashionable you just don’t know what your going to get!

I would be careful about ordering clothing or products unless you’ve deal with vendor and know their product.   Unfortunately products I’ve order in the past don’t resemble photo. Very deceptive.",2021-10-24 17:58:35,Panache54
400,Addictive app,False,5,"This app is amazing to find different items for any occasion. However, in my experience I recommend to always check reviews before purchasing items cause you may receive something that’s contrary to the image that is shown. Other than that i use this app very often. Thank you for existing!! As for a suggestion to make this app even better, ALIEXPRESS please give the option to have unlimited amount of wish lists! I currently have exceeded the max amount, which is 10 and I want to make more wishlists however I am not allowed to. Also using coupons on this app is a bit complicated and not straightforward.",2020-08-21 07:24:23,Liselim
401,Pretty good app,False,4,"So gar I enjoy using the app more than going online on a computer. I enjoy playing all the games. That being said, there are a lot of things to toggle through so that get’s a little confusing and when you do check out, prices fluctuate from the posted discount prices to the full price. Then the discounts apply later and it that also gets confusing. I do wish that when you made a purchase already and waiting for it to be delivered, that the product prices would reflect the purchase price and discounts that were applied at initial checkout. Promos come and go and I’m looking for easier ways to compare prices and remembering how much I paid for an item initially.",2020-12-03 02:50:41,Tiayako
402,I can find almost anything on AliExpress!,False,5,This website has nearly everything a person could want from quirky gifts to can’t-live-without items. I always plan a month for shipping so I shop very early. Most items reach the U.S. within 2 to 3 weeks. Items shipped from the U.S. are often delivered only a few days after ordering. I have not had many issues with items I have ordered but the sellers have been very easy to work with the few times I have had a problem. I believe payment is withheld from the seller until an item is marked received so I am conscious about marking shipments received as soon as they arrive.,2019-10-26 12:47:52,U.S. Ali Express fan
403,READ MY REVIEW,False,5,"Well I would recommend AliExpress as a good place to buy. But sellers in the App have to stop deceiving buyers with higher Cameras Quality So the buyers can actually know exactly what they’re buying Ok, Sellers don’t have to deceive buyers with camera effect to beautify their items Ok. Is so annoying when you receive items and look more law in quality than what you saw or paid for in the App. Ok! So Sellers be warned and take note of this review carefully.. Kindly Post the item exactly as it looks in reality, Post your item exactly the way it looks in real life, and stop adding more beauty with camera effect. Thank you",2021-09-02 18:52:31,Wizzi peny
404,Review,False,3,"It’s cool you just need to talk to your sellers about improving customer service with speedier responses and show their own version of the clothing they’re selling bc a lot of times we the consumers order clothes according to the picture they put up and be disappointed sometimes when it get to us and it’s nothing like the picture. Also can they stop making everything in that cheap polyester material everyone can’t wear polyester, and they would probably get more sales and better reviews if the quality of their clothes were better. Some are charging $20+ dollars for clothes and the material only makes them worth $10 that’s kind of a rip off that’s one reason why I had stopped ordering on here bc everything that’s reasonably priced is cheap looking.",2019-07-13 22:58:06,jdaddyword
405,Buyers beware,False,1,"- questionable price gauging and false advertisement on prices- for example, a deck of card priced at $1 changing to $6.99 when added to cart, literally switching prices in real time 

-will show a price for one product (ex notebook, .99cent ) and when you click on the product, the item is listed with other cheaper items and the you’ll find the .99cent pricing was for a pencil 

- automatic cancelled orders due to platform issues. No order number but you’ll see pending charge to credit card 

- trade assurance is not as advertised. You’ll be directed to the merchant to resolve refunds or pending charge for cancelled orders- whether you, the merchant or Alibaba cancels your order. 

- customer service is a bot and when you finally get a human they’ll tell you to wait while they help and switch off to another agent because the platform does not recognize wait time and will start counting down seconds until it disconnects. When you opt to continue to wait, another agent will hop on and ask you the same question but you’ll not get a resolution 

I do not recommend this platform for small businesses unless you have disposable income you want to gamble with and hope you get your order one day.",2022-11-22 21:10:16,Shinbop1283702
406,too many issues,False,2,"i truly love the app and the products you can find on here, my issue is none of my info is saved. i've made countless wishlists and saved items for later and some how all of them get randomly deleted and everything i saved is gone and I can't find it again. i've been having this problem since i downloaded the app years ago. what's the point of having a wishlist feature if they're not being saved? i've had an order be randomly and automatically canceled when i put my payment method in (apple pay) due to ""security risks"" and i switched to using apple pay because everytime i enter my card info to be ""saved"" by the time i go back and order something new, it's not there. it's really inconvenient",2022-10-27 02:50:11,z. onyx

Hand they products are just worth it seriously, but keep in mind to look closely at the pictures so you don’t claim you’ve gotten the wrong thing.

408,Very BAD EXPERIENCE / DO NOT USE THEM,False,1,I recommend no one to use Ali Express Or their vendor EVA HAIR OFFICIAL. They have failed me and lied repeatedly. I spent $280 and that’s including shipping. An they have not returned my money to me. I don’t have the hair or my hard earned money. Sad part is I never usually order through online because I’m afraid of something like this happening. I can’t see they face or talk to them only through a stupid online and no one knows what the left hand doing. I’m so upset that I didn’t follow my first mind an the comments on the hair where not good at all through EVA HAIR OFFICIAL. I did everything they asked me to do and I have all the proof an they still lied to me literally! Ali express said no worries we will get your money and lied an closed my case without me knowing. So if u go through them u are risking a lot. But I’m just giving my experience.,2022-05-02 19:26:30,Klassietee

Since I bought these things . And now I able to process a refund that’s going to 20 days or more for it to process into my account. so who knows if that will ever happen just don’t do it. I purchased from peoole with all good reviews and 5 stars . You are Better off buying from other places. Just pay the extra money so you can actually receive it ✨ don’t do. Trust me .

410,The best if you are not in a hurry,False,5,"I’ve purchased about 75 items from AliExpress in the last few years. Yes, the shipping takes longer, but I plan accordingly. The prices are phenomenal, and I’ve never had an issue with the safety of my payment information.  I’m very happy with the quality, especially shoes and clothes. You find styles no one else is wearing in the US (yet), for a fraction of retail. Plus the sellers bend over backwards to make sure you are happy.  I had a parcel lost one time, which the seller identified and contacted me to make it right.  They have great sales on 11/11 and Black Friday week, and have free shipping on most items. Highly recommend.",2019-12-08 15:43:27,AtteFam
411,AliExpress review,False,5,This review is for all the express is actually quite a easy place to buy and order things it’s just as easy as eBay I need to have the protection so that if you don’t like the product or somethings wrong you can get a refund so it’s money back guarantee just like Ebay and a lot of people say it’s not safe but it’s quite safe as long as you know what you want to buy and check it out very carefully and make sure that you put your address very correctly before you send or buy a product check your address again you shouldn’t have any problems,2022-09-02 00:11:44,Lioncat 4
412,Live chat function is crap.,False,3,"I tried live chatting with customer service and it’s mostly automated. Not only, that it loads pre-set questions you might have over top of what you’re typing to the CS rep. So much so you can’t see what you’re typing anymore. Then, if you press enter/return to send the message the presets don’t go away so you won’t know if it sent unless the CS rep replies. And the app will possibly send out one of the preset replies that have one of the keywords you used after typing your own as well. If not that, the presets will stay up and your own message will not send at all. Would appreciate if this function was fixed soon. 

Also, for some reason only 60 of 100 items in cart show up. Even if items are deleted it shows 59, 58, 57, etc..",2019-09-03 19:03:03,ShirReeneBean
413,Tiny tiny tiny pictures!,False,2,"If you are shopping for nail polish get out a good hand held magnifying glass plus magnifying glasses of at least 300 strength. If they made the pictures any smaller there would be no picture. You can see the color of the polish in a bigger picture but when you go to order it all the colors come up in these ultra tiny thumbnails and now you can’t see the color you want. It’s very annoying and makes purchasing very difficult. You don’t have the option of enlarging the thumbnails either so I have to take a picture of the thumbnails and enlarge the picture,  grid out where the color is, go back to the tiny thumbnails, and count out the grid. The only reason I gave two stars is the larger pictures are true color pictures.",2022-10-17 14:00:18,Skpellwood
414,Prices never match the product photo,False,3,"I like the app, but I really wish they would fix the pricing at first glance. Every seller selects the cheapest item/accessory item from their products & posts a photo of the actual item. Something that costs $5 first looks like $0.79. Example: I see a photo of a doll for $0.79. When I click the shop I learn the doll is $5 and a little doll dress is the listed price. It is misleading to see a product photo with another product price listed for it. The only way to check an item and price is to click each shop and each item. This makes browsing the app much more time consuming. I like shopping here, but the app could greatly use this improvement.",2022-09-14 14:57:24,UltraSonoRayGirl
415,Illegal charge to credit card,False,5,"I liked this app until my credit card got an unauthorized charge for an order that was placed in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. That’s what I woke up to this morning. 

The item was in my cart for a purchase at a later date and I did have my credit card on file with this app. I am now removing everything from my cart and my credit card on file as this app is corrupt and will place illegal charges/ orders to unsuspecting customers/ victims. 

Beware. You will be next. I already contacted everyone I could on this app without any solutions.",2021-04-24 18:31:10,TR8THn8rse

The few things I am a bit disappointed in, is the lude. explicit or inappropriate pictures that end up on my feed.   Also when I search something I end up with way too many products that are are irrelevant and should not be included in my search.  I would like it if the vendors had more guidelines and didn’t just fill their descriptions with a dozen key or buzz words to get their post popping up everywhere, even if they do not pertain to the search.

417,Would give it a 5,False,4,I would give it a 5 but it has a few bugs and I know it’s with the app and not my phone since it’s happened on my new iPhone. The app freezes lags won’t load crashes. The video are annoying and no way to turn them off of auto play. The tracking system isn’t correct most of the time I’ve received orders and the tracking system shows it never left China. Also don’t waste your money on faster shipping I’ve spent at least $800 altogether for express shipping since I need it before a certain date and the orders still take just as long or longer than the free shipping option,2022-04-13 05:21:05,freemind04
418,eh,False,3,"Aliexpress is pretty hit or miss. You can find some pretty cool stuff for a low price but depending on the seller, the product description could be inaccurate to the real thing. Shipping is also a common issue. Most people have to wait 3 weeks to a few months for their stuff to arrive. From personal experience, the most I’ve ever had to wait for a package to arrive was about a month. I ordered a shirt from this same order which never ended up coming which was such a shame. 

On a more positive note, this site has a plethora of things to offer and there’s something for everyone. Just make sure that you read reviews and be cautious of which seller to buy from so that you don’t get scammed.",2022-02-12 00:01:56,serenity4598

The App is easy to use, with lots of daily bonuses (to give you coins for vouchers) and freebie giveaways. The sellers on the site are excellent, and in general responsive and supportive and items are good and match the description. 
You can use the app alone without relying on the site which is a great feature, and I highly recommend it. The only small downside is that that delivery might take time so I advise you to be patient.

422,"Excellent deal app, needs better search filter",False,5,"I live in a low variety and expensive country. AliExpress offers a huge variety of goods and prices that make it fun to surf and hunt for deals. 
At times the search filter brings up a whole lot of content you are not looking for, so patience is required to swim through all of it. 
Another HUGE plus is that they offer fair shipping costs their competitors do not.
Last but super important, AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE. Not everything has arrived as it should (once got something broken, one never arrived, one arrived not functioning) and AliExpress gave me the easiest no hassle money back return.
Highly recommend this app!",2020-01-18 09:55:24,Recoilius
423,Great Site,False,5,"I recommend AliExpress as a means of purchasing products at a cheap price for your online or retail store. You should research the products in their entirety. Read reviews and understand sizing, for example clothes. You will find that a lot of clothing are in ""Asian Size."" You should buy 1-3 sizes larger than your regular size to fit these clothes. Overall I enjoy browsing the many products that are offered on this site. Shipping can take a while  on some products, but hey it's coming from China.

When I see ads for something I like I always come to this site first to see if they have it also. They usually do, for much less money. I don't mind the wait for delivery because I get such good prices. Recommender to many friends.

I received a prompt refund from seller, with no issues. The second one kept saying they shipped the item, but for two weeks, it still said waiting on item from seller. The third and final purchase was the worst. I asked a very specific question and the seller flat out lied. I received the item and was angry at being lied to. Requested a refund. The seller asked me to delete my dispute saying the item wasn’t as described and open a new dispute saying I no longer need the item, so it wouldn’t go against their shop! I refused! Got my refund the next day after reporting the conversation. I am done buying from this site. Nothing but a giant headache.",2022-04-29 06:07:50,Paje16

Have placed so many orders and spent an embarrassing amount of money… the items ship really fast within a day or two…. Takes a long time to deliver (but that’s just me being impatient because half a month for an item to deliver from China to America really isn’t that bad).

427,Shipping 🤨,False,5,It’s a very good app and I would definitely recommend it but I did write another review on one thing that they should fix but it’s an amazing app you can find almost everything under $60-$100 it’s just crazy that they have almost anything super cheap I just bought pit vipers and they will be coming in July 24 the shipping takes a long  time but most of the time it’s fast but I think it should be faster I ordered something in December and it came in June that was a little outrageous and I think they should do better with the shipping but other than that it’s a great app!,2021-06-29 14:39:24,barba morelli
428,I Love This Store!!!!!!,False,5,"With this app, you get what you pay for. A lot of the items you find in any other online or brick and mortar store is bought from AliExpress and resold at a higher retail price. So cutting out the middle man really benefits you. I don’t mind the wait for the items, even though it’s about 1-2 months. I would 100% recommend. Just make sure you look at the sizes and shipping price of each item. I’ve bought a lot from this store and had no problems with my credit card information, so it’s safe. But, if you’re worried about putting in your credit card info, I recommend buying a VanillaOne debit card.",2020-08-22 22:54:44,Bhjebfibfjdkdnnd
429,Needs improvement,False,2,"The returning option on the app is the absolute worst. The return policy is already ridiculous with the free return policy being 15 days after the “on time” delivery date. That means if my package came later than that date I would have less days to decide on the product. Sometimes the date will be corrected but if the date was not changed, then buyers can’t do a return after the 15 days. But even if you do return within the 15 days limit the free return labels take forever to load and you can only do it in the app. If you try to do it on the web it doesn’t work and tries to get you to use the app. It seems as if AliExpress makes it harder for you to return so they don’t have to give you your money back.",2021-06-16 16:36:53,百米白米
430,Amazing!,False,5,"I love AlliExpress, of course you get what you paid for but most of the things are the same that the ones you find at the Store, the only thing thats changes is the packing. I have bought a lot of stuff from AlliExpress half price, saved me a lot of money using these app. *CONS: It does takes 3 weeks to a month and a half to receive the goods.  I am patient so there’s no problem with that. 
*ADVICE: Always try to order with months in advance. 
-Each store gives you coupons like $1 dlls off, $2 dlls off. (The more you buy, the more you save)
-Always read the reviews on every single product.

They reply quickly and address the problem without giving you much trouble. If it wasn’t for that fact, I probably would not purchase from here anymore due to the unreliable merchants.

433,Buy American?!?,False,5,"Admittedly, I have always tried to support US manufacturers but AliExpress has really evolved to cater to the US market with lot of free shipping deals. Unlike US manufacturers, the Chinese vendors rarely use shipping fees to hide additional markups so even the shipping fees are often less than a dollar! I used to rely on Lazada and Shopee in the Philippines which were as much entertainment since translations often ended up with many unintentionally funny ads. As long as I am OK with a month or longer shipping times, I can find a lot of items which just is not normally offered to US customers!",2022-07-30 19:17:49,ibigmarami

I keep going back to items that I had put in my buggy and it says that the number of items has been edited because of demand for the product or something like that. It will not let me delete that item from my buggy I cannot alter the number I cannot do anything with it.

435,Addictive,False,4,"Wonderful app. I spend too much time there cos there seems to be sth for everything, at amazing prices too. Just wish the order numbers could easily be correlated with the product being bought especially after a dispute, when u get a message that your refund has been issued. It's usually difficult to figure out which dispute has been paid for especially when you have multiple disputes going on. They should use images to indicate, or make the order number a link on such cases such that as soon at u click, it takes you to the image page immediately. Reason for the 4 stars.",2021-10-17 10:27:31,Tundrakin
436,Aliiexpress is nothing more then thieves,False,1,They sent me an email saying my package had been delivered to local post office and was ready for pick up. It was supposed to be shipped to my home not a post office. Tried to open a dispute and was told I could not open dispute because package had been delivered even though I have not reviewed it. After contacting customer service I was told there was nothing to do and I should just call my local post office. I live in Chicago so that narrows down to a couple of hundred post offices to call. Aliiexpress is a joke once they have your money they do not care about you at all. Aliiexpress stole over $70 from me for face masks during a national pandemic (covid19) and then told me to fend for myself. Just so rude and disgusting! I will never order anything from alliexpress ever again!!! The entire company is made up of crooks and criminals and they are not to be trusted!!!,2020-05-08 13:51:57,dhdysbdy
437,My go to shop,False,5,"I used to shop Wish a lot. Tried AliExpress for nail products. Soon tried other things as well. I feel AliExpress has better quality products, and I am rarely disappointed. When people do leave bad feedback it seems to be due to not reading the product description well or at all. ART! Holy crap, the prints, painting and posters I find on this site are AMAZING! I can’t get enough! Very cheap - mostly due to no frame - which shipping overseas does seem like a good idea. I can buy an amazing, beautiful work of art for cheap and just need to frame myself. I just bought my first home and my walls are pretty naked. Soon to look amazing!",2018-12-23 11:58:44,intothepretend
438,Good,False,5,"It’s a good app. I get a lot of things here. Really good for buying little gifts, but I wouldn’t recommend buying electronics or other things like that because they might not work, but other than that I really like this app. Most things are really cheaply made, but you can’t really expect a lot from this app because you buy things for a cheap price. I like to buy cute jewelry and stickers and little thing like that on the app because they come really good and don’t get ruined. Most things take along time to arrive and come in different packages even if it’s from the same store. Overall I really enjoy this app and id recommend it.",2018-11-17 02:02:55,Dans bed sheets
439,"i love aliexpress! but there are a few downsides, of course",False,5,"as all apps do, aliexpress has some flaws. it is an amazing app, and has many good items; the most prominent ones being clothing. i can’t even describe how many clothing aesthetics are on aliexpress, but i’m living for it!

now, back to the flaw part, some sellers are dishonest and can change their prices, which i have not encountered much. it’s only a small number of sellers (during my encounters), though, so you can but worry free most of the time! also, if you buy small items, expect for it to come insanely quickly :D",2022-10-22 20:17:04,venti <3
440,Love AliExpress,False,5,You can pretty much find anything on this app.  Don’t forget you can take a pic of something and do a visual search as well.  I’ve had a few deals go bad but usually the dollar loss isn’t enough to lose sleep over.   I’ve only had one or two items never appear which usually results in sadness over not receiving the item more then the money loss.  Having said that I encourage you to read reviews before ordering.  If there are none you might want to pass.  Clothes are tricky because they are sized for tiny people so be prepared to order xxxl 🤪,2021-08-21 17:42:45,Jrchr
441,Love shopping with AliExpress,False,5,I have ordered so much from AliExpress and love the prices. Yeah I have to wait sometimes over 2 months but worth the discount!!! I find AliExpress carries a lot of things that cost us normally over $20 and find on Ali for less than $5! Well worth the wait. Sometimes I get really impatient but usually calm down by the nice people selling. I really do most of my craft shopping here on AliExpress. Such great bargains and great people to buy from. I am rarely dissatisfied!!! Sometimes run into issues and sometimes not resolved but for the most part I’m very pleased. Thank you AliExpress for all you do!!,2020-11-06 20:34:30,funhun94
442,Communication with stores for products,False,1,This app is so hard to use to get contact with stores for me and i had to go online because i realized my orders never came in which is my fault but i never got notifications from the app when i received a message from stores asking to confirm my order and i had them on. Also be careful what stores you buy from because the ones i ordered from my products never came in even though they said it was shipped. Also it says i confirmed the orders that i never received. But it is my fault for never making sure if they came in or not. I hope that you make sure the store you buy from is safe and if you don’t receive your orders contact them immediately before it says you confirmed it since you won’t be able to do a dispute to get your money back.,2021-01-02 07:28:26,_c.c.c
443,Amazing Shipping and Responding,False,5,I got my items within a month time period and not to mention it was fast! I am so happy with items I purchased Amiibo cards (VERY) cheap and the seller was so nice about it to and very patient! I am so happy to say that the quality and amazing the shipping was worth the wait and everything wasn’t banged up like people would think. I am just so happy that my package came and I am so happy everything is so good as well! There are amazing deals with amazing items things that you think you may not use in everyday life but turns out you use it everyday once you buy it that is how much I love the items I got!,2020-07-07 10:06:01,Sophia G.P
444,Functional and easy to use,False,5,"I really like the way that this app is set up, it is straightforward and easy to use. I particularly enjoy the way that you can make custom wishlists. Being able to see customer reviews on products is really great and helpful! There are great deals and for the most part the products that I have purchased have been of decent quality, and checking the customer reviews is a great way to gauge how good the quality will be before you spend your money on it. Overall I have spent many hours browsing the gigantic amount of products they have and I really have no complaints.",2020-03-11 16:34:59,Tashi is a unicorn!
445,What great deals!!!,False,5,"Easy to use and very trustworthy! I love the low prices and original products! I get so many compliments on things I buy for the home and clothing for the whole family! I never have to worry about wearing the same thing as someone else! They also have freebies daily which are definitely winnable (I’ve received more than 3)! The only drawback is that sometimes it takes a long time to get what you ordered, sometimes I forget I ordered something and am super happy and surprised when it arrives!  I love this app and recommend it to everyone I know!!!",2022-05-20 16:44:12,Whdeybiedh
446,Shipping slow,False,4,"I love AliExpress but there are a couple of issues.  The time to shipping is highly variable from vendor to vendor.  

AliExpress should enforce quicker time to shipping of its vendors.  The time to shipping is from the time the order is placed until the vendor actually ships the item.  Perhaps vendors need to provide quantity in stock parameters.

The second issue I have is regarding truth in product description.  AliExpress needs to set rules for vendors products descriptions.  For example, products advertised as genuine leather should not include synthetic materials including PU leather.  This is to the benefit of all parties, AliExpress reputation, vendors who are actually selling genuine leather products, and AliExpress customers who want to know what they’re buying.",2020-01-05 23:13:33,cgmeng
447,Be wary and you’ll be okay,False,4,"I have gotten a lot of cool things from AliExpress. I’ve also gotten a lot of horrible things, and my time and money wasted.

Remember to always read reviews and never order from sellers without reviews.

For one example, I spent $50 on a pair of heels, then asked them to send me a photo of the heels. They sent the photo, which was not like the stock photo, so I tried to cancel, and they refused to. I contacted support and they said to wait until I received the shoes to dispute it. So I finally received the shoes... made of the incorrect materials, RIPPED, and even somehow wrinkled and dented, with some kind of plastic bag visible inside the shoe platform. I opened a dispute... and have now been waiting days for a response. Why waste my time making me wait months to dispute it when I knew the shoes were incorrect from the start?? And even despite these issues, there’s no guarantee I’ll get a refund.

AliExpress is great for items with lots of reviews. But if you stray from those popular items, expect that it’s a 50-50 chance whether you’ll receive complete trash or not!",2019-06-28 02:41:29,Kittyhisses
448,Over all a great experience:),False,4,"I’ve had a few items that never made it to me but after filing a claim I was refunded. The process is super slow with just about everything so don’t get anything that you need within a certain amount of time cause you are at high risk of being disappointed. However most items are great for their price and as long as you’re not in a hurry, you will receive satisfactory customer service and for the most part the products. There are many things you can get from AliExpress that you wouldn’t see in the United States, so if you want something that is unique and different from everyone around you then you will love AliExpress:)",2019-06-02 03:43:02,akm_2018
449,"Not good With time or communication, and super unethical!",False,2,"This app is getting worse by the day. The sellers are extremely ethical, the people who are running this app or an ethical, they do not refund money when items are completely destroyed it, or not as described. Anybody can put my quality on something and it still shows up very cheap. Becoming not worth it. Also about 15-20% Of the items I have not received. Everything always gets lost or takes way too long to ship even though I pay extra to make sure gets shipped quicker through epacket. They go on holiday and don’t turn off their shops. There is no automated message saying that they will not be able to ship for weeks at a time. Very frustrating to deal with overseas people. Much easier to go through LA we are surprises on hand!!!",2017-12-22 08:57:17,Thumbs down Amazon
450,AliExpress,False,5,"I love finding all my favorite items on AliExpress for less than other stores. You can get Freebies too!! I get wholesale prices on rhinestones, pearls, epoxy, paint powders--- everything arts and crafts; clothing, shoes, accessories, electronics ( i got a mini pc )... Some items require longer delivery times ( most vendors ship out quickly but local delivery slows the delivery process down) but with how much you save it's a no brainer that patience pays. Compare with your go-to online or brick and mortar stores. You will save money and you'll love the convenience on items you won't find anywhere else. 5 stars",2022-01-20 16:38:40,TToni9
451,Great stuff for reasonably good prices.,False,5,"Ali Express is a great platform to buy some of best stuff that you can never find in local stores and even if you did,never for the price Ali Express offers and most are with free shipping. I love all the stuff I bought here and I definitely recommend Ali Express to everyone. I love shopping on AliExpress and whatever I bought are really exclusive and the best. Everyone is complimenting me on my purchases. Its better than buying from local in-stores and big brands online. Definitely recommend AliExpress to everyone who wants to buy great stuff for less prices!",2021-09-09 20:18:01,RamaRam64
452,Ease of shopping,False,5,"This site provides multiple options to view in every category of products. Many are quality and you can develop a relationship with the vendors you like. For the most part I am pleased with my experience. As with everything, do your research, as not every vendor is honest. AliExpress does provide protection for the most part. I do wish once someone reaches a certain level, there was a way to communicate a little more easily in a direct manner, with the AliExpress team so that they would penalize the dishonest vendors. Overall I highly recommend.",2021-09-03 21:31:38,TIVW
453,Ali express is a great find,False,5,"A good selection on good products. My first “men’s watch” is bigger than I prefer. I wasn’t familiar with the app and didn’t know where to find all of the specs. Now I do. You should know that a $16 watch will not be as good as a $200 watch (or whatever you’re buying), but the items that I have received are easily $50-$80 products for around $20. 

They take weeks to months to arrive, and I’ve never tried to send anything back (after 2-3 months for shipping, I’m not sure how that would go), however my orders were during CV-19, so maybe shipping took a little longer.

Overall, it’s worth a try.",2020-08-02 11:48:57,no nicknames lesf
454,Missing items and no recourse,False,1,"I placed an order with “Nine Month Store” they were missing 4 items I purchased. They said they combined shipping but missed sending me part of the order. I reached out to them and they said they can’t help and for me to contact someone else. They would not give me a name or address to contact someone and we have been discussing back and fourth for weeks. I belong to four large scrapbook clubs and will be mentioning this. There is no reason for this to be such an issue. I used to love AliExpress and praise them but if these are the types of vendors they endorse, I can no longer endorse AliExpress. It’s sad because every other transaction in all other areas has been highly professional and great…. If something changes and I become satisfied with the customer service, then I will revisit this review",2021-07-30 20:54:56,The real sirens 143
455,Good app,False,4,"Some times I can find the same product in the US cheaper elsewhere, but I like the app. I have received faulty products which is a problem because shipping back to China is at your expense. For example, I bought a pottery wheel that was not correctly wires and would not turn on. It would have cost the price of the. Wheel to ship it back (I think), so I found an electrician to rewrite it and now it works. I wasted a lot of time videoing the wheel to prove that it was defective to be told, basically, pay twice and we will make it right. Despite that and higher shipping, I do order regularly from AliExpress and occasionally from alibaba.",2021-03-28 13:04:31,Rob@openspacesfarm
456,I gave it a chance and it scammed me 3 times,False,1,"So, I bought three packages that went missing. Now keep in mind I have bought from here before and I got my stuff before but of course these three didn’t. Two of the packages were supposed to be delivered on the same day which was October 26th haven’t arrived. It’s been exactly a month. Now my last package was apparently already delivered which is was not. And I already called to the post office and usps three times, so this isn’t my post office’s is fault because I have received other packages from other websites besides AliExpress. I asked the seller to tell me where my package is but they posted the same screenshot of evidence showing that it was delivered when it wasn’t and since the 16th of November, they keep telling me to wait “a few days” but it’s been a week and 4 days since I’ve waited only a “few days”.",2020-11-26 16:41:13,XxMeifwa_GamerxX
457,Unusual  Items Reasonably priced,False,5,"I’ve been shopping on AliExpress for several years now and I enjoy the low cost of many of the items and a lot of the items are unusual. If you have a problem you can always contact Customer service. That’s the only thing , when I first started on AliExpress I didn’t like  because it was difficult to figure out how to complain.  So  in that way the app is not that user-friendly. Well if you figure it out they are very fair and they will refund your money if you have issues with the seller. That’s not a really big problem it doesn’t happen that often.",2020-07-02 06:24:56,Sarah3241
458,China shops on AliExpress,False,5,"They have everything people need because they are about people and items plus tools we need to function, not just entertainment and electronics! Plus a selection of things we liked not just the most trendy junk set out as bait to capture your money!
For example: I found decorative rollers to paint wood-grain on the front porch I just painted with brown deck paint. At the best paint store in my area there’s nothing like this! The proprietor asked where I found this? I showed him on my iPhone. This tool is obsolete and unheard of here in New York; it is no fun.
  My wife and I want to be joyful in our house, and this decorating tool will make our house special making us happier every time we see what we painted. Here only money motivates what is available and everything is overpriced so we cannot buy it.(BORING!)
Stencil rollers don’t make enough money so they’re not there.
 Also the stores on AliExpress have (imagine) genuine good manners; they don’t just patronize you. 
Thank you AliExpress for making our day better",2020-03-04 16:36:29,GoldStainless13
459,Don’t do it,False,1,"Ordered an item that was listed as having over 9,000 “in stock.” Waited for the “processing time” only for the seller to tell me that he does not have the item. He says he doesn’t have it because of a very large order, sends me a screenshot of the order and it was purchased two days after my purchase. So instead of taking the item down from his store, he not only keeps it posted, but he raised the price almost double. Contacted customer service and was told that the seller has to refund me. A refund (for over $100) will take up to 20 days. Tried to contact customer service via chat again and am getting a bot that will not direct me to a live agent. I will never order from this ever again: it’s a fiasco and honestly most of the stuff on there is super low quality and tech is likely counterfeit in my opinion. Not a trustworthy retailer.",2020-04-04 10:37:21,dontwasteyout
460,I’m enjoying using AliExpress,False,5,"I was hesitant at first. I’d seen some pretty things, but kept hearing about how long it took to get items. I was hesitant about communication since most items come from China. But I’m pleased.  I’ve made several purchases. It doesn’t take several months like some posts indicated.  Most of the things I order come within a few weeks.  Every vendor sends out their items so even tho you make one order, it’s actually several orders unless you are specific about vendor. I get little packages of ribbon and embellishments every couple of days.  It’s like Christmas when I open my mailbox. I love it.",2020-02-27 12:30:34,Sandradar
461,Great app for a poor teenager lol,False,5,I love this app so much. I have used this app for over the past two years. I think I am addicted to this app because I have bought over 86 items. Most of my items have turned  out great but the items that haven’t turned out great I was able to get a full refund no problem. It seems like I get a package every week LOL. The only thing I don’t like is the shipping sometimes. The good news about the slow shipping is you sometimes get free items because they come right after you finish your dispute.  The thing I like the best is the good service from Ali express and of course the low prices,2019-06-03 04:03:40,###BestAPPEVER
462,Disappointed,False,1,Some of the a customer service when I contacted them about my item being sent to a different address they gave me a dispute that was not available and they refuse to answer my questions and they were just terrible with me and never answered my questions. She told me you have to wait two days for me to open a dispute and get my money back. and that’s all they keep saying I should be allowed to get my money when I need it like now... since it is there fault they can’t copy a correct address ...not when they’re stupid app wants me to get it back...After I told her that the link does not work she kept re-sending and re-sending and re-sending that stupid link like she was on play and I couldn’t do anything because she  completely ignored me very disappointed... they should get fired for there lackey job and being so disrespectful.,2019-12-09 19:38:30,Very rude customer service

I especially like the translation ability of the chat with the sellers. Sizing is sometimes difficult to interrupt but most reviews are helpful. I think you get what you pay for on the app. Not everything is the best quality. It also takes a while to ship to US, and it can be frustrating to see where an item is in shipping.

I like some of the other reviews got the lighter version of the wig which I was hoping for!! I am happy because I think the color is hard to find.

So what they do now is ship out broken, defected, badly manufactured, etc... items that they can’t sell in their shops to us here in the states. Then when we file a dispute they are now ONLY giving you the option to ship back for a refund knowing that it’ll cost 60+ dollars on an item that costs a few dollars and we won’t spend that money to do that. They used to be fair and return a portion but now, like I mentioned above, they’ve figured out how to screw us over. DO NOT USE THIS SITE AND DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM.

After our lawyers advised them that the document they requested didn’t exist, we still received the automated message and were unable to collect our refund.

470,"Good app, but need some improvement",False,3,"When confirming goods received or after leave feedback, it jumps back to my account, and not back to last place (the order you just confirmed). This is very inconvenient if you want to confirm or leave feedback for multiple orders because you need to scroll again through all your orders from the top of the list to get to the next order you want to confirm or leave feedback. Result = I already placed hundreds of orders but because of this annoyance I seldom confirm reception of orders (=seller will not get the money upon reception of the goods) nor leave feedback (not share comments with other potential customers).

I’ve tried with some gift cards I had not used but are still available (aka not expired) and still couldn’t buy what I wanted.

Then they tried hounding me about the money. Saying “I think you CAN pay me, dear” Being called dear is something I felt REALLY uncomfortable with. So, at this rate, I’m going to let my payment period run out unpaid.

The only issues I have had are knowing the right size to order in shoes and clothing. They seem to be all over the place but most have fit. Most of my purchases have matched what I ordered.

Also... I don’t think I’ve ever typed anything into the search bar that they didn’t have!

Maneuver through this site is by making sure you check the reviews, with photos and estimate shipping date for item before purchasing because of not then what your purchasing may be a hit or miss.

And shop around for best price if your on a budget. Quality is all over the place but read reviews carefully as well as descriptions. Sometimes very misleading so.. but get it! It’s awesome for us with little money! :),2019-03-19 15:24:37,Kola loo
477,"Overall, a well managed shopping app",False,4,"One thing I do not like to use app is due to some minor information would show on computer web browser but been skipped on the app. Those minor information sometimes give me a bit more detail but not showing on this app. (Such as dispute related things) I do not know an app supposedly to show exactly identical information as on a web page or should be a slightly simpler interface and simpler information. To me, using this app is okay, but some times I still rather to use my computer to place orders and shop items , rather than using this app.",2022-11-21 21:01:57,Everestchen
478,I love this app for the most part,False,3,"I have a small business and my supplier stopped selling a item I needed and wholesale it is hard to find so I turned to Ali express, the shipping used to be a flat shipping fee no matter how many of the item you got which I absolutely loved! It’s usually not the biggest deal but sometimes the shipping hike is insane. The only other compliant I have is when things don’t arrive you just have to deal with it, I don’t like disputing with my bank but I had to recently over some Pom poms that didn’t arrive but said delivered and they were a combined delivery order so I waited to see if they came separately and they didn’t and the order closed. The app is good tho!",2022-02-24 22:35:20,hnsxoxo
479,Worst online ordering experience ever,False,1,"The worst ordering experience ever. I ordered a product to be shipped from the US. They shipped something from China, so it did not arrive when it was suppose to. Then once I received the item it was not as pictured or described. I sent the request to the seller to do a return and they refused to give return info saying that it would take too long for them to receive the product and issue refund. So they agreed to just refund my money. Now almost 2 months later I still have not received a refund, the seller has stopped responding, and Ali still has not handled this issue. Even though it is Ali’s policy to resolve the issue if you can’t get resolution with the seller. Worst experience ever. I would not suggest that anyone waste their time or money ordering from these crooks.",2021-11-21 04:49:45,Da'Lishus

I love the bracelet!! I’m into the chakra and the evil eye bracelets , I have a few now, about 5 of them have broken because they were way too small when they arrived. And when I tried putting them on they snapped. So try to pick the bracelets that have sizes to choose from or it will be very small. I love the pearls and enjoy shucking the oysters myself… I love the baby pearls. I will continue to order from Aliexpress.",2022-07-10 04:27:52,trejaxyaya
481,Account randomly under review and can’t reach customer service,False,1,"I’ve been a long time shopper at aliexpress but this whole past week I have been trying to place and order and they keep closing the order out automatically. First they said I needed to verify my account so I did that and not one minute after they verified me, they said my account is now under review, restricting me from buying anything. I run a business that requires I purchase this daily and it has completely hurt me. 

I have tried to email and chat with customer service but the email bounces back and says it’s too full. The chat box doesn’t let you get past the automated robot.

It’s disappointing and frustrating to say the lease. My account is basically frozen and I have no idea why or how long this will be for.",2021-03-21 01:40:09,91396783
482,Terrible customer service.,False,1,"I’ve lost money six times.

The problem happens when the logistics information indicates that the item has been successfully delivered, and when I ask the seller about it, they always ask me to check the local office which is fine, except I clearly have put the address where I want it to be delivered. The post office checks and tells me it says it has been delivered to your address at ___ date, which I know already, since it is what my app says. But I still don’t have my item, so where do I go from there? 
So I open dispute to try and get a refund, it always ends up with me not getting my money back.
The overall experience is just stressful and you’ll lose 20 bucks. I honestly have given this app multiple times and so far I’ve lost 100 dollars.",2020-07-10 16:56:10,amornicole
483,Love it !!,False,5,"Only thing I’d ask is if they could try and put shipping down ? It’s aggravating as well as a way to use all ur coins not just some to save 2 cents. It’s also frustrating. They have a good system if anything is lost or missing, they refund and let u control it. I just wouldn’t get comfortable if I were them, customers matter and I see little flaws here and there and they should be more attentive and not let everything go like they did last time. There system is working pretty well now but always room for improvement.",2022-01-01 22:39:03,Hetaliafff

It’s so nice not to have to worry about losing these ones because I bought 3 pairs for just a few bucks. They have other great items like backpacks, shoes, and stickers. I’ve also purchased some small tools and bits for my drill that work great. Shipping usually takes about a month as everything is shipped by boat but it’s well worth the wait.

There is a sizing chart but over half of the items received simply do not match the chart. I wear a US Medium and I have to give my purchases away to family because it’s to expensive to return items to China. Yes, I read the reviews before purchasing & some are really helpful. I’ve tried ordering 2 sizes larger and that didn’t work either. I must say Simplee Apparel is the boutique of choice since their sizing is compatible with US sizing. However they don’t offer everything. Guess I’ll be looking for another app to purchase my apparel.",2021-11-27 15:24:04,TenahCG
487,You need to know,False,5,"You need clearly understand what you buying, if you pay minimum, obviously shipping would be forever. So don’t get angry with seller.
But be be careful about ending of buyer protection time of each item you bought. Time would be different. And if you don’t receive item, complain in time frame that you’re protected, you will be refunded.
I miss this many times:))))
Just recently I got package that is from AliExpress, but not what I ordered, I complained about that, but trucking shows: item delivered. I don’t know how it would end up... but I will be from now more careful about, because I just got one more like that!!! Park of plain paper, or something like that, super bad quality.... I assume it’s going to be one of those: item delivered.
Looks like some people start talking advantage of good platform. I shopping with AliExpress for more than 12 years! Never have trouble like that!!!!

488,Very fast shipping!,False,4,I’ve ordered several times from this app and all experiences have been good overall. I did have one order that never made it to me (lost in shipping is what I was told) and I was in communication with the seller about getting a refund but that’s taken a couple months between a lot of back and forth and I still have not received my refund or my order. My most recent order that FedEx bag my items were shipped in arrived with dirt on it and small holes so some of that dirt made it inside the bag and got some of the items dirty. Other than that I’ve been happy with ordering through this app and the sellers.,2021-03-12 00:19:58,helpmecancel
489,Great place to buy quality items for a reasonable price.,False,5,Everything comes from China so that’s the first thing you need to know.  Shipping may be a little slow and Asian sizes are a lot different. I normally wear a men’s large but when ordering from here I order a size 3X.  And to get the best quality shirts I get the polyester or polyester blend shirts.  Colors are vivid and material repels water fairly good.  Much cooler than cotton.  All the Marvel collectibles I’ve found here are also of good quality.  I’ve had only one problem with an order placed through Ali Express and they resolved it for me with no problem.  To date I’m very happy with Ali Express!,2019-10-07 22:19:30,Born2color

Wonderful products, but not worth the wait! It’s been almost 3 months since I made my purchase. I have received only half or less than half of my orders!!! One order was cancelled by Aliexpress 3 days after the payment was made and I still haven’t received my refund!
I ordered and the first part of my shipment arrived at the location I requested. Then, the rest started arriving piece by piece at the post office that is an hour away from where I live, and I have to pay additional tax for each piece and pick it up myself!!! 
I’m so disappointed!! I’m so angry!!! I tell all my friend never to try your app (it’s a shame because we would’ve been great customers)",2020-09-04 16:53:00,sumayyalicious
491,Love this app,False,4,"I love shopping here only downside is that sometimes your items take a little bit longer on shipping or they accidentally get shipped out to the wrong address, but I have gotten refunded the couple of times I didn’t receive my package because of it going to the wrong location. And that whenever I have had to dispute a transaction the customer service was right there and extremely helpful with my issues. I truly enjoy shopping here where I literally can find just about anything I need or want to purchase and can ship to myself or to my choice of other locations which is perfect for sending random gifts to my grandkids!!!",2020-08-19 20:35:43,hammer-momma
492,Too expensive shipping ripping us off,False,1,"I have ordered clothes, electronics and accessories from all express for 5 years straight. But now I have stopped for many reasons. Shopping cost is out of hands, costing triple the price of any blouse for example. I’m very disappointed. Everything was very affordable previously and now it’s not the same. As if Ali express is trying to rip us off. And as a Asian, those 100$ shipping is ridiculously expensive. However this might not be the case for other European countries or American as their currency is top rated. Anyway I don’t think I’ll ever buy if this continues. I have already started using other online apps to buy like shein (which is a top brand in AliExpress) and buying directly from them through their app doesn’t charge the ridiculously expensive shipping that AliExpress charge when we buy something.",2020-06-09 20:04:11,Middle class female

Some things take a little longer to receive but keep in mind that these are vendors from all over the world. I have bought jewelry, socks, dresses, bras, electronics, leather bags, hats........

494,No dependable,False,1,Ive ordered from multiple online websites and this one has given the least amount of help toward the customer. Ive always shopped on AliExpress but recently Ive had an issue where I didn’t receive an order I paid around $20 for. Obviously the seller continued to lie and refuse to give me a refund and AliExpress hasnt helped me whatso ever. I dont have any proof photographically and thats all they want. The product never was received in MY mailbox but I cant proof it in a photo. I even called the local post office and they gave me a number to confirm that It wasn’t received but that doesnt matter since Im required to show some kind of photo. Ive never been more upset about this and Im most likely never ordering anything again. You lost a customer that has been loyal for years now. I do not recommend this app unless youre willing to lose money at some point.,2019-09-22 15:58:18,Anastasiaxxx3

I don’t want to create a new account in order to use the new version. I’ve been with you too long and have history established. 
When I update the new version on my iPhone, it replace the old version and took the existing information to the new version. I don’t have to do anything. I just use it as normal. Never interrupt my service.

Shipping does take some time and be sure to check shipping options including tracking if USA customer. There are some USA houses for some sellers and/or products. 
Have not won a freebie yet, but the site has that feature! Site is easy to use and checkout with many options including PayPal for most items. Game plays change features a lot, not often in customer’s favor, but they are games anyway.

497,HUGE SCAM,False,1,"I wouldn’t be surprised if they delete or change this comment, but it’s my human duty to warn new users about this app and who are you actually shopping from. 
I just lost a few hundred USD and this can happen to you! 
That’s what’s going on, they charge you for the item that you purchased and they give you approximately 2 month for delivery . 
when the delivery time is due you won’t get your parcel, instead they extend the delivery time by over 2 more months WITHOUT your permission. 
When you contact the seller about your items, they provide some fake tracking number that ONLY works on Chinese parcel tracking websites and not UPS or USPS! 
When you open a dispute to get refunded after 4 month of waiting, they’ll tell you that your items are in the local USPS and you can go for a pick up, but when you contact the local post offices, you’ll see there are no items matching your name and address, but they won’t refund you unless you provide documentation that proves the fact that you didn’t get your orders!!!! LITERALLY WILD GOOSE CHASE. 
After using your money for 6 months and make profit off of it IF YOU ARE LUCKY you’ll get HALF of you money back.

498,Good budget shopping site for Chinese specials.,False,4,"Ali Express is a good place to grab Chinese made products at a steep discount from retail prices. The quality of the items varies widely so I strongly recommend buying only from reputable sellers. Also, shipping can take four to eight weeks on most items so don’t expect two day shipping or anything like it. Customer service is poor, you’re kind of on your own. You can’t call or email or anything.  I ordered an item and I hadn’t received it after eight weeks.  I filed a dispute within the Ali Express app, but they said I still needed to wait for the item to arrive (going on three months without so much as a tracking number).",2020-07-31 22:32:30,Dustin Squared2

They froze my order to stop dispute that disappeared after they change or status to frozen order. I have a screen recording. If you decided topurchase use   paypal to dispute charge and screen record purchase and any thing you do on app or website. This company is one of the reason for info breach and false charges on you card not explained. Everything cheap is not a y.

A purse, packing accessories. When I think of something I want- I check Ali express first. You can’t get better deals. Sometimes the shipping takes a while so you have to plan ahead. I haven’t had any issues using this app. Everything I paid for I have received. One time I was sent the wrong color robe and the seller was quick to respond and send me the right robe at no extra cost and I didn’t have to return the other one!

The transactions went smooth and never had any issues using the app and placing orders. I can chat with the seller to find out more about the products. There are some that does not respond quickly and some does. I did benefit with some coupons that pops up on my app like $10 coupon that i can use which i think is awesome. Just a tip if you will buy somthing just do a thorough research with the product before you buy and as well the seller’s rating. Hope this helps!,2019-09-29 05:58:47,Matinikk
502,Great place to buy things,False,5,"Do research on here especially look at the actual review pictures before you buy anything because there are quite a few sellers on here who sell things they should not be selling meaning… Bootleg items, but there are also people on here who sell very high-quality bootleg items that are just as good as the original that you will spend a lot more of money on so just do your research and look at the review pictures because that is what you will be getting.

504,Good site but has issues,False,4,Now less expensive than Wish. I wish they would back up the buyer more than they do. Not always a good outcome when we file a dispute. They want you to prove that you did not receive an item when you did not receive the item. How in the world do you do that? Maybe take a picture of an empty mailbox. There are also allot of really bad sellers that either don’t send anything or send you something that is different than pictured. I still shop there to get great prices. Just be aware that you may have to spend time contacting them many times.,2022-11-21 21:43:15,BoggChicago

506,Meh!!,False,2,The AliExpress app isn’t very good. Still no way to actually contact a real person or an option to chat with a rep when an issue arises. The AliExpress coins you collect are useless and a waste of time to collect. Unlike Bangood points system that are actually useful. With AliExpress there is no option to exchange them for coupons. Very seldom you may find during checkout you can save a few pennies (literally) on a double digit purchase but rare. The only other options for them are select sellers that may allow a few hundred coins for a couple dollars off but only from sellers who’s price is higher to begin with and still winds up costing more than buying that same item from another seller without coins.,2022-05-15 01:27:44,TAZ2041

We would like to speak with a real representative or do a live chat when we needed help for a refund, a inquiry we have with the seller and etc. Very difficult to talk to the seller because most of them don’t speak or understand English. When we have a problem regarding my purchase and ask seller, he or she cannot understand or answer us either correctly or they don’t answer at all. We need a number or email address where we can contact regarding to our issues when the seller will not help or don’t understand.",2022-03-18 10:45:08,Fvnvkrfhvrj

510,Pretty Good,False,4,This store is pretty Good if you are shopping for weaves/wigs they are pretty good. This app allows you to follow the stores you buy from and the seller that sells you the product communicates with you until your order arrives. I’ve only ordered a wig from this app and so far I’m pleased the shipping was quick and they give you a tracking number you just have to take the time to read the reviews from the store you are buying from to make sure you are getting your money worth. Also they are having back to school sell so all of these things are pretty cheap. But do remember you get what you pay for so if you pay cheap you get cheap!,2020-08-05 02:31:42,jayjays1

At first I thought that AliExpress was like Wish because the items take a while to ship but are cheap. Before I ordered anything, I read the reviews on the item and the store. I don’t know if these reviews are made up or what. This app is horrible and almost all the sellers are just trash. I spent $300 and received only TWO of the items after FOUR MONTHS of waiting. And the fact that I have to file a “dispute” to get my money back and don’t even get back the full amount that I paid, AND I have to wait 20 days.. this is so ridiculous to me and I do not recommend anyone to download or buy anything from this terrible app. If I could rate a negative star I would.",2020-05-15 05:00:29,taylorashlee1818

I like that it translates reviews to your preferred language and will filter reviews by location or whether or not they include a picture so you can personalize your content by what matters to you. I also like that you can search for images, so you can find something on the site even if you aren’t sure exactly what it is called(this has helped me identify toys my nieces wanted).",2019-04-09 16:37:46,jeniwoo

519,Good app,False,5,"It’s a good app easy to understand and navigate. I’d recommend it as a place to shop for fun items as long as you don’t mind waiting anywhere for a few weeks to several months to get your items. Customer service is quick to respond when help is needed, most (not all) sellers are also quick to respond when questions arise. Fun app overall lots of cool items but keep in mind shipping takes time, quality is not guaranteed and enjoy shopping. Clothing is not best quality, but smaller items are usually good.",2021-09-28 14:18:05,Minnie_2012!
520,Amazing,False,5,I just wrote a long resume but I bought the AirPod to headphones for like $12. And they came in like five days I couldn’t believe it. They were slightly smaller and the real thing but everything else is almost identical. I’m in shock and can’t wait to see you and hope that you guys have more products because I’m chopping from you guys from now on if that’s the case. Thank you so much and Can you reach out to me so we can start dialogue please? If not I will contact you great store and now I’m not getting paid for this I’m a regular guy in Pennsylvania.,2021-04-15 21:59:55,noadsman
521,Great Marketplace,False,5,"I’ve been using AliExpress for a couple years and have bought thousands of dollars of merchandise to resell on eBay. The sellers are usually very professional and take care of any problems quickly. When there is a dispute AliExpress has always handled it in my favor. But overall I usually don’t have any problems. Shipping has gotten much quicker over the last year, considering it is coming from China. I bought one large order from a seller, with free shipping, and the seller upgraded it to DHL. I had the order in less than a week.",2021-02-10 01:36:08,Nick's Lame Name
522,aliexpress is the plug!,False,5,"I have bought many things from aliexpress already and I must say, it is worth the wait since nearly everything from there is from China. i have received compliments on some things I got there, and i totally recommend y’all to try it out plus everything is dirt cheap.
they got everything from wigs, pins, shirts, shoes, even house necessities and everything else. 
i do have to warn you that a lot of things on there are rip offs of other brands, counterfeits in other words and usually come in cheaper quality —unless you don’t care and just want to look good on a budget.",2019-02-17 21:04:37,defsoulbum
523,Worst shopping experience ever. Won’t recommend it to anyone.,False,1,"So I ordered from the seller, and found out the address was not correct. I contacted the seller to change my address, and they said notes it. How we up on shipping, it was still the wrong address. Therefore I contacted the customer service which is a joke. She said yes I left a note and don’t worry I have corrected it. Then after a month long waiting, the shipment was delivered to the wrong address!!!!! And now I can’t file a dispute because it’s over the 15 days window and can’t claim I didn’t receive the product and get my money back. Also they charged me cash advance when I used PayPal to pay for the order and the customer service girl said her manager will look into it and get back to me which they never did.",2021-01-17 23:42:11,vanessa。sun
524,Absolutely horrid experience!,False,1,"I purchased a wig for my wife. After waiting a few weeks for it to arrive we noticed it was not as described. The density of it was low, you could see through the hair in the back and there was dozens of short hairs sticking straight up in the front. We asked the seller for a refund and they told us it was not possible. I then filed a dispute through AliExpress, they approved the return and I payed 32$ to ship it back. Once the seller received the wig back they claimed it was damaged and they could not resell it(even though AliExpress previously deemed the item as defective.). AliExpress immediately changed their judgement and released the funds to the seller. Now the seller has both the item and my money. I filed a dispute through PayPal and my Bank and finally got my money back. Stay away from this app and this company, they are a scam!",2019-02-18 06:15:30,Egocentric12
525,Definitely worth downloading,False,5,Shipping is almost always free from my experience. Everything is so cheap and good quality. The only bad thing is that sometimes the shipping can either take a month or two or it can take a couple days. Just plan ahead if you’re ordering something just in case. They're really helpful with returning things. Just use common sense because sometimes the clothes might be too small or it's not exactly how it is in the pictures so always check the reviews but other than that the app is perfect and I always come here to buy stuff.,2017-10-22 22:51:05,Secret is a secret
526,Overview of Site,False,5,I have been ordering from AliExpress for the past 9 years and I have had no problems.  The communication via email has also good.  When ever I had to communicate with AliExpress they have been very helpful.  If there is something wrong with your order they either refund you or send out new.  The only thing that has been getting harder is the delivery dates are almost over a month.  If you want it sooner the pricing on that seems to have increased for shipping.  This id still a wonderful site to go too!,2022-10-19 23:51:05,dear91
527,Not the worst thing ever,False,5,"I’ve only ordered two things and I have yet to be disappointed. Despite it having super cheap stuff it will take a while for your orders to be delivered which is fine. All I suggest you do if your worried about being scammed is look at all the reviews, product information, specifications and shipping prices. There are usually a bunch of different varieties of stuff you wanna order which is cool. As an example I was looking at cat paw mouse pads and found a black and pink one, another seller had a red one, and another seller had mint green one.",2021-03-19 13:45:39,OsirisIrisEris
528,Love AliExpress!!,False,3,I love shopping on this site! The only thing I do not like is if it takes too long to arrive and also the returns! I received items that were too small but could not send them back to exchange I was told to just order the correct size which is hard to tell when you are ordering online and some stuff run big and some run small… Their exchange policy could be better! I did receive a broke protect but the store was cooperative after I sent them proof so at least they are willing to refund you if your item is damaged! Other than that I love shopping on this site! I always find good deals and some really good stuff on here….,2021-11-28 02:40:13,**Leesha**
529,One stop shop,False,5,"I love Ali express I was very skeptical About it because it was coming from so far away but I bit the bullet and took a chance and now I can’t stop ordering you find so many things you wouldn’t normally find it’s an awesome app budget friendly and everything’s pretty cheap. Mind you I have NEVER ordered anything from Aliexpress til this year, So if you’re thinking about trying it out, you definitely should. Just like any website you order from ( amazon,ebay,wish) be aware of sellers, really look at items and check reviews. Other then that TRY IT OUT you will be hooked !",2020-10-14 19:06:20,Khyrissa R
530,"Great website, great deals!",False,5,"At first, I didn’t seem to trust this website cause it seemed to good to be true. However, my friend uses this website a lot and has said nothing but good things about AliExpress. So I decided, sure why not order something from them? And once I did, I honestly can’t stop. And yes, some of the items may take forever to come but it shows the tracking of your items when you buy them and after you buy them. Not to mention, the prices are great. You can also contact the seller, and read legitimate customer reviews which I think is great.",2020-05-07 06:52:10,hytffdwdffgh
531,Great,False,5,"Haven’t had any issues with buying or receiving items I have bought like other sites I won’t name...!!! Great prices and great sellers...!!! The app is smooth and flawless doesn’t boot you out etc like some of the other apps... even has mini game and task to earn coins to be used towards coupons or items plus a small fee like 1 cent usd...!!! Thank you and keep up the great job 

P.S. I even clicked on something as my phone fell out of my hand to buy now... and with the click of a button order was canceled no hoops to jump through etc.",2021-01-26 20:51:17,bubbajai82
532,"10 successful orders, good experience, but confusing promotions!",False,4,"So I’ve dealt with marketplaces before where the goods mainly come from the PRC. I won’t name names but I’ve done much business with one horrendous one and another one, a pleasure. The rest of the marketplaces are just cheap carnivals.

 After a few years and hundreds of orders I figured to go big, because I was intimidated by the sheer size of this entity. Thousands and thousands of vendors, thousands and thousands of customers, billions of transactions. And I am not a fan of promotional hype, because in my experience it ends in you spending more rather than saving. 

AliExpress has a smooth escrow service, payments are quick, you can communicate with vendors freely and support chat is 24/7 with a real human. But my god, the promotions and customer reward system clutters the UI and is also confusing. You get coupons that say “$10 off” but then it turns out to be 5 $2 coupons, valid with select vendors products. 

If AliBaba closed the gates on its hype machine, AliExpress would be much smoother.",2019-09-01 18:48:43,Its That End User Again
533,Bring me back to the previous screen after confirmation,False,4,"I’ve been using this app for awhile now. Each update has helped make it smoother. The glaring thing that has bugged me is the following: when reviewing “my orders” under “my account”, I would click on “goods awaiting confirmation”. When I click to confirm that I’ve received the good(s), it should ask for a review, then bring me back to “goods awaiting confirmation”.... as it is now, it brings me back to “my account”.... very annoying and delays confirmation/communication as sometimes I don’t go through this process again until a week later even though multiple orders have been fulfilled.",2018-01-27 13:24:43,Ronie73121
534,Bad customer service,False,3,"I dot know if AliExpress manages the sellers but some of my orders that I received was so bad and I asked for return and refund. However, some of them was so rude and required me to pay for return fee while they said free return before I make the order. Others asked me to return but gave me only 3 days for the processing while so live in America and I must take like a month to return the item. I even check the customer service of AliExpress too but doesn’t work at all. That make me feel worried whenever I want to buy something this website coz I don’t know if the goods are as pictures or it will be so bad and they won’t refund money for me.",2022-07-08 02:13:59,hedbbdbajjwkdj
535,User friendly,False,4,I enjoy finding items and the app is easy to find things. With that being said I think the communication between buyers and sellers could be better Having to scroll down to find orders gets old… and then the page resets when trying to track the shipments. There are some vendors who get away with misrepresentation. I’m not sure how much of the disputes and the reviews are monitored. And what’s the point of coins? I don’t see how those offer any real value. Maybe I’m missing something? Just some quirky things. I am still very happy and will continue to utilize it! 🥰,2022-06-27 23:46:38,SRB Solutions
536,Not the same anymore,False,1,"Aliexpress used to be the best app on my phone since corona started everything changed first of all only 40% of stuff that I ordered arrived to Morocco the other items never arrived and the refund process is just terrible now it takes too long and also now when I buy something, after the paiement is confirmed, the item just doesn’t ship it stays there until the process time ends so now I realize that I have wasted over 5 months of life waiting for items to arrive and waiting for my refund, honestly I’m very unsatisfied and I’m about to delete the app not because of the refund or anything else but the fact that the items never arrive and that is the whole point of this app, is shopping and that need is no longer met.",2021-05-04 13:06:32,Momo:(596322):
537,Love it!,False,5,"I love AliExpress. It’s very easy to use and a very safe way to shop. I also love this app. The worst thing I know is trying to shop online but having to deal with either a really slow app (like F21) or a buggy app ( like Michaels) or even worse: stores that don’t even have an app, forcing you to access their web site through your browser. AliExpress is none of that. The app is easy to use. It doesn’t crash. It even has a photo search function so that you can screenshot the products you see on all those Facebook ads and buy them from a more reliable seller.",2020-08-07 23:46:15,AngelicaAllshouse
538,Pretty decent,False,4,"The app is fairly easy to use once you get used to the format. My only wish is that there be a home button to take me back to home page from anywhere in the app. If you are at a shop page or looking at an item, you must back out before seeing a home button.

I like that there are coupons available for most items, as well as how easy it is to contact each merchant. Their suggestions are pretty aggressive in that once you look at something it will automatically suggest similar items. This can be good or bad.

Overall a nice app for shopping. I do hope they clean it up a bit.",2020-09-20 01:09:45,USMC720
539,Done shopping on this app!,False,1,"I have been a long time shopper on AliExpress 
I always told my friends how wonderful it is and to ignore bad reviews because I’ve been buying so much on here and never had a issue I loved it! Until now! I bought something in beginning of February and still haven’t received. I figured it got delayed because shipping does usually take awhile and with the Coronavirus i just thought I’d give extra time to receive it. It was marked as delivered but I never received it. I tried to contact the seller didn’t get any help there so i opened a dispute that was denied. I wanted my item I did not want my money back but if I can’t get my item then I at least want a refund. I’ve purchased on here for years now and never opened disputes never had issues and now I’m out 30 dollars with nothing to show for it.",2020-06-19 21:00:41,Neenerz12692192
540,Surprisingly great quality hair,False,5,I only use Ali Express to buy hair. I gave up a few years because it’s hard to find a good vendor but decided to give it another try and I’m happy I did. I found an awesome vendor with quality products for an amazing price. I save so much money buying from Ali Express vs buying from other expensive sites. The app is so easy to use and makes it easy to browse and also rate products. They offer coupons by vendor and also by site so you save even more. Theirs always sales and the communication is great. Can’t speak for every vendor or product but so far so good.,2019-03-26 01:20:12,30TBaby504
541,Customer service is a joke.,False,1,If I could give 0 starts I would. I ordered a vanity from a seller on the website on 5/19. It said it would arrive within 2 weeks. On 5/26 I was told that the item shipped when it had not. Was provided with a fake tracking number as well. The seller then changed the shipped date to 5/31. Provided me with a tracking number. I tracked the package and it shows that the package still hasn’t even shipped!! Filed a dispute with AliExpress which takes forever because they need to give the seller 5 days to answer 🤦🏽‍♀️. When I asked for a refund the seller was very rude to me. He called me greedy and impatient. Then tried to blame to long ship time on riots and coronavirus. As all of this is occuring i am still unable to get in contact with a physical person. There customer service is an automated chat. A huge joke!,2020-06-09 01:39:22,MLBdkgie
542,Great app,False,5,If your looking to order quality products for cheap I highly recommend this app I’m sure there is some junk on this app so I recommend reading the reviews also if your in a hurry to get the item the shipping speed is different for each item it all depends on the seller and if it doesn’t ship you will receive a full refund so there’s no risk I also recommend downloading the 17TRACK app to keep up with your orders you just put in the tracking number and you can track your items it works for any order from anywhere not just this app,2020-11-18 13:14:23,SRW800

544,This app and company is one big scam,False,1,"And Apple protects them. Apple is literally deleting reviews that are negative. (I wrote a very fair review for this app even outlining positive features.) so let me make this quick.  Seriously, if you spend money on aliexpress you will be scammed. There is no way to get your money back unless your bank lets you do a charge back. Aliexpress will lie and laugh at you if you try to open a dispute. More than 75% of items are a scam. Long time user, I finally deleted the app. I bet this review will be deleted soon or never allowed up. For instance, last purchase was a battery pack advertise 30k mah. They sent a slow charging 1k mah that can’t charge my phone. It’s a glorified over priced flash light that doesn’t work. Save yourself a hassle don’t use this app.",2021-11-18 22:09:31,Quint T.

It’s great quality and is exactly like described. Is reassuring that I can also talk to the sellers if any issue. There are products here and there that don’t match the picture, but you can always return it with the warranty the app has.

Also you order a product and before you get your product it will take eternity for it to arrive, like one I have ordered since beginning of January and up till now the seller is still processing the order, I have sent series of messages no response, and it’s for a wedding ceremony scheduled for next week for a group of people, I don’t even to what to tell them right now. It’s so alarming!!!!",2020-02-06 16:43:19,Blestjewel
547,Best shopping app,False,5,"This is my go to app every time I see anything advertised on Facebook because I can always find the same thing here for a cheaper price, and usually free shipping. 
The app, Wish, comes from the same buyers and Ali Express is just the Express version of Alibaba. Alibaba only ships to the coastline then you have to figure out how to get it to your home or business, while AliExpress will ship right to your door. Always check the size of what you are buying and contact the sellers if you need specifics. They will work with you and even offer a cheaper price if you buy in bulk.",2019-09-23 22:41:57,misspocos
548,Fun informative and pleasantly addicting,False,5,Fun and informative but addicting:) sellers are all responsive some shipments come grouped which may slow earlier orders placed. Just keep a good record of your orders so you can confirm receipt. I'd also recommend taking pictures of any issues to share with sellers. All in all I highly recommend and will continue using. I appreciate the savings on items coupons and recommendations. Messsge buyers with questions and inquiries they may have what your looking for. Thanks Ally nice site service and products.

549,One of the best,False,4,One of my favorite places to shop. So many options of sellers to choose from. You do have to take time and search for the best. But it’s well worth it. Haven’t come across a site with better prices. But also sometimes it may take your orders awhile to get to you. So always make sure you’re paying attention to the shipping. And always check reviews when you’re ordering from a seller. If the seller doesn’t have reviews be careful. They are most likely new. And you have to take one for the team. I’ve had maybe one not so great order over the 50 orders I’ve made. Definitely try them out. And leave reviews.,2019-04-27 14:47:32,belle3qui
550,An experience like no other,False,5,"In short, this app is addictive. If you live in the US, most items will arrive within 1-3 months, sometimes much quicker. It’s often like getting yourself Christmas presents and awaiting or being surprised when they arrive. Lots of cool things for crazy low prices. Some high quality selections professional audio tools like mics and other things like anime figures etc. it’s addictive to have an app that has games, social media, shopping, forums, and more all rolled into one. It’s wild, and I honestly love it. Too much.",2022-06-02 03:21:50,Chopin2121345

 Love browsing different categories because I invent a lot of different things, searching on here is way faster than google and go to different stores.  
The sellers are also extremely accommodating and answer questions no matter how strange.

552,Happy about my products & delivery,False,5,I was worried about getting my costume in time for Halloween. I ordered on October 17 and with express delivery estimated delivery would be October 29. I received it October 27! It was packaged very carefully in tissue paper & sealed well in a bag so as not to be loose & get crinkly and wrinkled during shipping. The quality of the products are awesome especially for the price! It doesn’t look cheap like a lot of costumes we find in stores. I really appreciate all of the accessories that were included. I just needed to purchase the wig separately. So happy and excited to wear it! Thank you!,2021-10-28 15:57:38,KaraLynn08
553,Amazing,False,5,The app is accurate and the shipping is reliable. I ordered shoes from here and they came on time and where good quality. After adding my address and payment method everything in this app runs smoothly. All of the items on this app are really adorable and the searches are accurate. Some of the shipping is a tad expensive but that’s on the sellers not the app. My mother and I love all of the stuff on this app and love ordering here. It’s good overall and I would recommend it to people looking for a good place to purchase a wide range of cute stuff.,2021-08-15 19:55:41,Catboy_Kool15

My best advice is to read reviews & use common sense! Of course we are buying imitation products but that’s the point! And that’s what we are looking for when going to places like this to buy stuff, they have so much good stuff at unbelievable prices!! Everything Iv ever looked for I have found minus 1 item. That’s it, yes they have EVERYTHING!!! Thank You AliExpress for being available to everyone not just wholesalers.",2019-03-07 20:31:29,Sunshinee37

The TRACKING SYSTEM IS BAD, sometimes the products came to my home and the tracking still show that still in transition. And sometimes things I ORDER DID’NT COME to my home and it show that it “delivered”. 9 things I ordered had went missing. When I open disputes, they ask to show evidence, the things is how can prove that the product is went missing???? When the tracking system is not right????

I didn’t realize how much i checked in everyday..and to think that I’d check everyday in general surprises me. I’ve found many cute and great things i can wear with what i have and wear with! I don’t have to worry so much about the sizes here, i just convert it. The prices on some of the clothes I’ve been finding are well worth it and they last pretty well too!

557,So far so good,False,3,"Still new but still loving the app. Can apply for free items though those who spend more are generally favored and get the more expensive items. Allows you to get in contact with sellers and as long as you don’t order from any sketchy stores there shouldn’t be too many problems. Though it is necessary to watch who you are buying from, just like other places there are quite a few scammers that’ll take your money and leave you with broken, wrong, or missing merchandise. Does not seem as if you can rely on their customer service as the app is only a means to shop from multiple stores at once.
Oh yeah and very very very addictive, your wallet has been forewarned",2019-01-29 18:49:01,98tab
558,Fantastic for resale,False,5,I’ve been ordering for about 8 years from Ali and I love it ! The prices can’t be beat anywhere and they literally have everything and anything . Do your research to get the lowest price because there are many sellers who sell the same thing  and always read the reviews . If there are pictures from previous buyers - make sure you look at them . There are some items to be weary of - as the seller pics are professional and don’t always match the item . Check the measurements too! All in all. I love AliExpress and it allows my business higher profits !,2017-09-25 22:27:48,Lorenmenenenenso
559,I really wanted to enjoy this app because I heard good things,False,1,"But my experience was terrible , after reading these comments I see that vendors are the problem and I believe ali express shouldn’t allow people to scam on there app when I requested a refund for a wig that was almost 50$ they declined because I have a small window for it to be delivered but I already waited almost two months .. then the vendor only gave me 23$ back out of the 49$ I paid for the wig because they sent it in the mail and packaged it …. Ups isn’t great either they recommend me to call them but Yk you can’t get a hold of them I wish I could rate this 0 stars for wasting my money and time wish has a better refund policy, so I don’t mind waiting a month but not almost two months",2022-12-01 12:21:37,thickblackpussy
560,Budget app,False,5,"When I first heard of this app, I assumed it was a scam. Consumers do not get what they purchased. But, after seeing my Jamaican neighbor's daughter in law attire and she informed me it's a legitimate site the only downside is that order delivery takes longer. So, I was convinced though I test it. Since then, I have been hooked. I run to Aliexpress for everything from clothes(sellers have good quality items, especially HIGH HEELS for a fraction of the cost), interior design objects, makeup, etc, etc. Ali express is my number one go-to store app for upscale fashion and home items.",2022-09-08 20:33:46,IstepNStyle
561,Great app,False,5,"Love this app. Make sure to read item descriptions and reviews to know exactly what you’re buying!! Everything takes about 3 weeks to ship but I have had some things come within 9 days. Give it a try! I know it sounds crazy to order from China, but it’s soo worth it. Just order something cheap with good reviews and give it a chance! You earn coins too whenever you buy something which is awesome. They add up fast. Make sure to check daily for free daily coins that can actually buy you stuff.",2021-12-09 22:05:45,Cupcake12594

Most of the time, I’ve received a refund when I spoke to the seller, but this could be prevented if packaging for products were better. Shipping also takes a long time, and it can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months.

563,New user satisfied thus far,False,5,Shipping has been ok. What’s expected at the very least. Some items even come surprisingly fast! Update: using for 2 years now and really enjoy this app. They have a lot more to offer compared to “Wish” and items are usually better priced and of higher quality. The tracking usually works and if for any reason you have any problems AliExpress is very good about customer service in my opinion so far. I recommend this app to people regularly. I hope they enjoy it as I do.,2021-10-21 17:48:29,GILLESPIE307
564,Amazing 🤩….!!!,False,5,"This was my second order , the first order took so long more than two months, thou when it came it was exactly as I had imagined , quality was excellent but I had to wait for so long . This worried me a lot and I was skeptical but I gave AliExpress another Chance because since I was impressed with the quality of the shoes so I ordered a beautiful dress this time.
. Wow …!!! I’m happy to note that my dress was as in the picture ,  quality was excellent,it fit perfectly, and most importantly this tym it arrived in the set time . I’m happy 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾",2021-08-25 00:12:43,Tigress...!
565,"Good app, some bad apples",False,5,"AliExpress is a really good app with a extremely wide selection of items all for a really good price. There’s just one downside, the shipping time. I understand that it’s coming from China and it takes forever to come to the states but 3 months waiting is a bit excessive.  But you get what you paid for! Good items sellers are mostly good except for some bad ones. They never ship out items in hopes of taking your money. But there’s a quick way to solve that so it’s no problem. It’s just really a waste of time.",2021-05-16 17:18:09,anabibialright
566,Good Deals,False,5,"AliExpress has some really good deals on lots of stuff. I’m happy with most of my purchases but not all of course but it’s definitely not a scam - if you do your research. Use it like ebay - make sure to read reviews, check ratings, and how long the store/seller has been on AliExpress. If it’s been on AliExpress for a while and the product has good reviews and ratings, then it’s safe to buy. Otherwise, be wary. Keep in mind that shipping does take a while so don’t get mad if it doesn’t arrive after 3 weeks or so. Also, shop during holidays, there’s sales on top of the low price.",2019-12-03 22:37:38,Pichu857
567,Everything is getting expensive.,False,2,"I enjoyed buying here, but things are getting more and more expensive for China standards. Some things are the same price if not more expensive than the stores in the US. For that price I’m better off buying here in the US than having to wait 1 to 2 months to receive my order. Almost everything now has shipping. And sometimes shipping is more expensive than the item you’re buying. I’ll think twice before I order anything on AliExpress from now on. And on top of that the app is just terrible to use on a tablet. I still don’t understand why they changed it. It used to be one environment for phone and a different one for tablet. Now it’s all the same as if a tablet were a phone. Duh!!!!!",2020-10-02 03:27:22,Piano student
568,Great Prices. Some Concerns.,False,3,You get what u pay for! I love AliExpress but you must do your due diligence before you order. Some things aren’t as quality as they look in the pictures. You have to read the reviews to get a good idea of what you’re buying. I’ve gotten some quality things from there and I‘ve gotten a couple things that look like i only paid $3 for. Also don’t expect the things you order from there to be here in time for an event. Order with no expectations as to when it arrives. Some things get here fast and some take awhile. Most are being shipped from overseas. I still order from there because some of my favorite clothing items have come from there!,2020-09-05 15:54:55,Tbombkilla
569,Love Allove hair,False,5,First of all let me just start by saying that I love love loveeee this hair it's cheap which means that it's affordable I will definitely be ordering from here again I will always give good feed back always a five star ratings there's no shredding it's very soft smells really good you can not go wrong with Allove- hair I promise you will not be disappointed I washed my hair before install and it still good and holds weigh I love the shine now if ya want to y'all should join and win free hair if I could win omg that would make soooo happy also when your order the hair they will send you a free gifts ... I love Allove hair and you should too.,2019-11-06 13:56:04,yvonneDior
570,Excellent customer service,False,5,I usually don’t leave reviews but I have been using AliExpress for a little over 3 years and their service is impeccable. The products are very reasonably priced and fit the description. The customer service is always reliable and professional. I haven’t received any products that did not fit description and the customer service is always reliable and they usually always shop your products within a reasonable time frame (3-5 business) Fantastic company to shop from. Always look at reviews for a better experience.,2019-05-02 02:35:27,Bellomeredith
571,Satisfied but could use some improvements,False,5,"The mobile version is very user friendly. I believe it is still missing some information that can only be found on the desktop version, as the time left for leaving a review on an item. I missed the opportunity of doing so recently, as the reviewing time was finished, and I actually had a bad experience with the seller. There is also an automatic button to extend the buyer protection time that is only available on the desktop version. Overall, the shopping experience is great on the mobile!",2019-01-14 10:27:07,mcb2391
572,Awesome App!!!,False,5,"I absolutely love this app, and use it almost daily. There are an endless amount of products, and the prices are excellent. There are fake items, such as jewelry claiming to be something it's not, so read the reviews carefully, and remember, if it looks way too good to be true, it probably is. Of course you'll find fake items on many other apps as well, such as EBay and Etsy. They also have fun ways to earn coins to get discounts, and many sellers offer coupons. I highly recommend this app to anyone.",2022-10-23 17:54:10,Yoyoverp
573,Quite happy I downloaded this application!,False,5,"The app is simple to navigate & understand! Finding what I’m looking for is easy as I follow my favorite stores to purchase items & can return on another day to view new items to purchase. I can also search for the items I am looking for if I can’t find them in my favorite stores. I simply review my orders, shipped items, & am able to track my items easily through my account. The shopping experience is simple & the items offered are plentiful!",2021-12-31 16:04:14,AR9262
574,Appeal processs,False,3,"The appeal process is taking way to long!!!
I can’t even buy anything until you guys process It! Also It took me a week to figure out why i couldn’t purchase anything, no one sent an email to let me know i wouldn’t be able to purchase! Which is very irritating. I’m a diamond member on here & this is unacceptable! I was forced to take my business elsewhere because your system wouldn’t let me buy. I’ve been with you guys for years but this is a serious inconvenience that needs to be solved ASAP! Also I’m not the only one this is happening to, three of my family members had & are currently having the same issue!",2022-05-12 14:48:30,Papigotthajuice
575,My feedback,False,5,"I like the items that AliExpress has for sale. The prices are very good. I know there will be a long wait to receive my items but I would like it if I received some updates on when to expect my merchandise. I had to wait for over 2 months for my order. I would be willing to pay a modest shipping to get my items quicker. Ive had some credit card fraud problems so I only pay with PayPal. Wish all your sellers took PayPal.
When I report an item wasn’t received, I’d like to be taken more seriously.",2021-05-31 12:41:07,Rere_M
576,Great Wholesaling Website,False,4,"Review all vendors on the site, make sure you check reviews and confirm shipping estimates with the store owners. Due to the pandemic shipping is taking longer, and they haven’t updated their options. So what says 30-40 days is really 50-60. Most store owners have a quick response time. (24hrs at most) it’s important to review the store because you don’t want to get scammed or receive an item that is nothing like the description. You’ll see prices for an item that are different, I would search that specific item to find the cheaper price. Don’t pay $16 for something that’s on there for $6 as well.",2020-08-11 20:46:00,breezyybabby♥️
577,"Shipping a little slower, but worth it for the savings!",False,4,"I have been purchasing on AliExpress for many years, and honestly, sometimes it can be hit or miss with regard to sizing, but once you get a feel for the merchandise, you can pretty much gauge what size you would need. They are also very good about listing if sizing is small for US sizes or if they are true sizes. Additionally, I have purchased many items on US sites that are coming from China and honestly they come slower than the things I order here.  I wouldn’t say to order here if you are in an absolute rush, but other than that I would not hesitate to shop here, and do so often.",2020-07-07 14:21:37,Lmb219
578,Great if you are patient.,False,4,"Alien press is amazing. Has tons of items I personally use for costume making, home projects, tools and fun gifts. Although some things are of less quality than real retailers , you don get what you pay for. Only thing I hate is that i have to wait a long time for shipping but I’m kind of patience and eventually forget I ordered stuff sometimes. They come to my mail as a surprise every time. I really wish I can make more wishlists to separate items I want but you are limited to like 10 I believe. Besides that stores will probably work with you on wholesale pricing if that is something that you do.",2019-12-17 01:58:20,Frankie251wtf
579,Searching and shipping tracking needs to be worked on,False,3,"As a whole the Aliexpress app looks nicely built.  I wish the product search also includes misspelled words. The email shipping tracking is of no use as the tracking email does not described what is being tracked except for a number. With this i would have to go back into the app and review my purchases and located what item is still in transit.  It would be much easier if the tracking email also included item description or the name of the item.

Also Ali Express defective return or item not received policy is not so efficient as the process of getting an item replaced or credited takes a while and the seller makes the buyer repay again and say they change the price to 1c after you place the order and still the buyer has to pay 1c on their charge card.  Totally ridiculous.

The looks of Ali Express website looks attractive but needs lots of work in the search department.  
I enjoy shopping at Ali Express and hope to see their website improve in the future.",2020-02-08 20:18:57,IPhone Critique
580,"So far, so good....",False,5,"Ordered several items and just received the first ones yesterday: only took nine days for these to arrive in Ohio (return address on this part actually said New York). Happy so far. Hopefully I will be just as happy with the remaining items when they come. App is convenient to use and saved a few cents on many items versus ordering on my laptop. Definitely hard to beat the prices. Unfortunately, I could waste way too much of my life just looking at all of the stuff being offered, stuff that I absolutely do not need, but it’s such a good deal....",2019-03-26 18:16:19,DublinGunda
581,Cutting out the middle man,False,5,"I am all for buying local made products from local stores, but it is not always feasible to do so, when it's not I see no reason for paying 2 or 3 or more Xs higher for the product to get it at the local store when you can get most everything on Alliexpress and pay the actual cost of the item. The quality is great and it is exactly what you would have found in the store and some times the quality is better. It gets shipped right to your door and the customer service is fantastic. I love it. I think you will too.",2018-06-18 11:18:19,vsguidroz
582,Becoming a SCAM site!,False,1,"AliExpress used to be so much better in the past before it became extremely well known. Now it’s just a bunch of sellers trying to scam you. I ordered two items last year and still have not received either. I opened a dispute for both but only one went through and now the time allowed to open a dispute is closed. I contacted the seller multiple times for a refund and all he/she continues to say is that my order has been shipped and will get to me in a few weeks (lies). Now, another item that I ordered from the site has been canceled while in shipment and there is no way to open a dispute unless I “claim” that I have received the item (which I haven’t). AliExpress itself does not help and now I’m starting to think that the site itself is just a big SCAM. Buyers beware!!! Just buy locally.",2019-02-11 22:26:18,Xsizzy
583,AliExpress,False,5,"I love shopping on AliExpress! The prices are great and not all orders take 2 months to arrive! I’ve been shopping here for years and have rarely been disappointed. Any problems I have had were promptly taken care of. The free shipping and low prices are what attracted people, but now, the prices have gone up a bit and some items have a rather high shipping fee, which is why I can’t buy certain metal dies now. But overall, they’re still a better bargain than what you can find in stores or brand websites.",2022-01-19 03:50:28,Pinkdragon58
584,Don’t use this store,False,1,"This store is barley even a store, its basically am elaborate drop shipping scam where you only get 25% of what you order because “logistics” will keep your package in california for 2 months before you can put in a dispute. Let me say that again, i ordered something and a whole month went by before it told me that i had to wait another 45 days to submit a dispute and get a refund for something THAT WAS ALREADY LATE. So just to be clesr you have to wait 2 months to get your refund for something that they “delivered” already. This app is a joke and every seller in is just a scam waiting to happen, i dont recomend this app to anyone and i hope the developers die of rona for basically stealing my money for 2 months just to not give me anything",2022-05-26 02:47:16,Tvtvtvtctct
585,Aliexpress is not as Horrible as someone may say.,False,5,"Yes there’s some sellers who won’t help you and are completely rude.  Things are hekkin cheap, though!  Not only that but you get quite a few sellers who work with you and you need to try all mailing services that the number you’re given could be tracked through.  If THAT doesn’t work then you should reach out to someone like usps or aliexpress themselves.  You will resolve the issue one way or another.  There’s plenty of good, cheap items and most of them arrive early, especially when you chose a faster shipping for them.",2019-03-01 20:49:47,Quinn the Wolf
586,AliExpress,False,4,"I originally got this app because my friend recommended it to me and I came in with a sense that it would be kind of low quality. Using it regularly, I have found something I dislike about AliExpress is that it takes awhile to receive items(definitely a waiting game), BUT I have experienced very friendly sellers and they are very helpful. There are also far more options then many stores and apps I have downloaded for shopping. The quality of the items bought are great in my opinion, and I have highly recommended it to my friends.",2021-05-31 03:37:16,#Notsurewhattocallmyself
587,It’s a gamble,False,1,"Small orders below $50 were ok. The minute I ordered close to $200 of mirrored tiles, it all went wrong. After 4 months of waiting, The manufacture said “ your parcel may be lost by post office”, the tracking Infor showed it has not even left China. I filed a dispute for a refund. Two full month later nobody is doing anything about it. My money are gone. This is how Mr. Ali got rich. He charges you full amount upfront ( you are basically advancing him cash, free of interest, for 3-4 months, in my case - 7 months), and when a manufacture “looses” your shipment, Mr. Ali disappears, together with your money . Well, I paid a price for a lesson. Buying from AliExpress is a gamble , all depends how much you are prepared to loose. Just keep in mind that there is NO consumer protection in this set up . All risks are yours",2021-04-11 23:33:45,4MaxMickey
588,Worse than Wish!!,False,1,If I could I would give this app negative stars. I will NEVER purchase an item off this site ever again. First time I’ve ever used AliExpress and now it’s the last time. I got robbed of my money and never received what I purchased. And I thought Wish was bad lol! Wish is horrible but wayyy better than AliExpress. Save your time and money and if you have to use one of these apps use Wish and not AliExpress. At least Wish refunds the buyer their money back if they didn’t receive their order. Unlike AliExpress where you have to do all the work if theirs a problem with your order and you still get robbed of your money and what you purchased and your back to square one again minus your money and nothing to show for it.  Seriously don’t do it. Even if it’s cheap it’s not worth the bs.,2020-10-22 17:08:23,rox4334
589,"Just don’t, even the app “wish”is better.",False,1,"I had to fight for my refund back. They didn’t want to get me a refund back even though on the tracking information it clearly said that the item was returned to seller but they insisted to not give me the refund. It took two months for me to get my refund back and keep in mind I NEVER received the product. They seriously knew that the item was returned but they kept arguing with me and neglecting me. Finally I received a refund but they only refunded me partial!!! Who knows why but I gave up because I’d have to put up with another fight with Ali express. Honestly just go download wish, this is waste of time. If you wanna save money go to wish. DO IT. But this should be your last resort, not even an option. Don’t do it.",2020-04-16 02:10:02,Jacquelinaaaaaa_

591,Great!,False,5,"If you’re like me and don’t make much money, (I don’t have a job yet) then this is a really good place to shop! If you shop safely and only buy from sellers 98% positive feedback, (or top sellers) then you will always receive your product. I have only lost one package out of the 50+ I’ve ordered, and it was because they were at 94% positive feedback. Which doesn’t seem bad on the outside, but on AliExpress sellers 95% or lower will rarely come to you as described, or at all. So if you shop smart, this is a great place! The quality only depends on your choice of seller. The app is great!",2020-11-03 23:23:58,Pans Overwing
592,Became untreated and against buyer platform.,False,1,"…AliExpress recently started to behave extremely bad in terms of refund for problematic purchases. I think not only me but a lot of other people may become the victim of the store recent judgement system updates. In my recent several unhappy purchases when I got damaged items I have opened disputes accordingly. What you think I got after? Nothing! And I’m talking about very obvious cases when items weren’t just scratched but completely screwed up. I don’t know what is happening with AliExpress judgment recently, but look what they wrote in the dispute closing: “According to the rules of the platform, we can only support sellers, please understand. Though the dispute is closed, we have suggested seller discuss with you.” Am I blind?",2022-02-23 18:53:57,crazy hobbit

Still waiting to receive, nothing after 3 months. I paid twice for the shopping cost. Contacted seller again. He said he will send another order. Paid again for shipping cost. Finally received in October. Wrong color . I received orange color instead of brown deluxe. I asked my money back from seller, nothing. I contacted support 3 times, with detailed report, nothing. I contacted seller again, he replied with a smile. No support from Ali Express at all. I spend 108 euros plus 49 euros taxes, for nothing!!!",2020-11-27 06:13:53,Greekcap10
594,Great,False,5,"Only downside is slow shipping, but it’s free and kind of fun to be surprised by something you ordered a bit ago haha. I guess I also wish there were more ways to organize your search list when multiple sellers carry the exact same item and I’m tired of seeing it over and over. There’s millions of things and at good prices. I am a makeup hoarder but the single novo eyeshadows are my favorite thing in my whole collection. It’s rare for me to get five of the same thing but it has a super shock like formula with smooth packaging for 2.50 so yeah. It’s fun to discover cool things on here.",2020-05-11 22:56:39,JayJayKay99

The products are almost always as described and if anything you could always check out customer reviews (if available) so that you can see what you’ll be buying beforehand. The service team is always super fast to solve an issue if presented with one but I’d say that for the prices you can’t really complain, you definitely do get more for what you pay which is just awesome!

If items don’t come through AliExpress does a great job of refunding your funds. But as a buyer you need to be aware of shipping time and keeping track when purchase protection time starts running out. Most sellers will resend or extend the purchase protection time because they do want you to get your items and give them a review.

For two weeks the seller said it was a system issue but oddly enough other buyers can purchase from them. How do I get this resolved? I think the person handling the return was angry and added me to some kind of black list. There’s no way to talk to customer support for Ali Express to resolve it so all I can do is post reviews everywhere until someone reaches out. The seller is UNICE so beware.,2022-02-28 02:19:30,Kdubb82_!
608,iPhone X glitch,False,5,Love the app.  Have purchased way to many to count items.  Keep in mind shipping can take up to 8 weeks.  However since last update I can only see 20 of my favorite items on my account when I have over 900 saved. Contacted customer service for account and she said to sign out and back in and delete and reinstall app.  Both didn’t work.  So my Ali for Ipad app shows all my favorites on my iPad so I have to scroll through on that and add to my cart to see that item on my iPhone X.  Please look for a fix for this as it’s very annoying.,2018-01-03 11:48:56,tandbuy
609,Disappointed!,False,2,"The app is great I guess, when it comes to deals and finding exactly what you need to start up a small business or just to use in general but what I dislike is that shipping normally takes pretty much 2 months !! And don’t even consider the faster shipping with items already in the US because apparently it takes even longer 😂 ! Again the app is great but I guess it’s the vendors ! Then they all have attitudes ! I wanted a refund because myy items have yet to move (they are still in the same place I ordered them in October) and I was told I can’t because they were already shipped when they weren’t ! Once I receive myy last 3 packages I’m definitely deleting",2020-12-07 22:28:10,princessStaar
610,Be aware,False,1,"Every time I purchased with no issue except the quality of the items. It is rear if get a good item through this website. If there is any good item in this apps, it will be very expensive compared with others. 
Now, my biggest issue with is, I bought a car break. It was damaged when it is delivered and i sent its picture to show the damage to the seller refused to send a replacement or refund unless i send the original one on my expense. Alibaba do not have also any solutions and the roll is to pay for shipping 
Regardless who’s mistake.
So, seller can send you a damaged or different item and buyer will keep or trash  the item. because it will cost us more than the item it self. total loss.
I will never buy from them again since they do not protect their customers.",2019-12-29 04:11:10,ابو محمد رضا الشيوخ
611,HIT OR MISS,False,3,"It’s good to see that CHINA has begun to produce very high quality items at prices only they can. Unfortunately there are still a good percentage of dirty unscrupulous sellers that give hard working, HONEST  Chinese sellers a bad rap. There are plenty good ones when you find them save them to your faves, read all feedback AND EVERY WORD OF THE LISTED ITEM CAREFULLY ASK QUESTIONS FIRST if you get no response you just dodged a bullet, good sellers respond and dont pretend they don’t understand you, translation apps are a dime a dozen..... and mind the time difference and their Holidays, and hopefully you'll have a good experience and end up with items for a fraction of what we pay in the USA, just gotta be patient.

Beware of AliExpress’s dark businesses anywhere.",2018-07-06 08:52:22,Emperor Tilacuti
613,Expensive Items are risky,False,4,This is not exactly Ali Expresse’s fault but the nature of business. When you are buying more expensive items risks are higher. The prices are so good that if once in a while you loose something you don’t care. But I bought an expensive item that the Asian store k ew it never shipped. It waited a month and it auto loses so I couldn’t make a claim. Then it took me tons of time to reach a live human being at Ali Express who told me it would take two weeks to process. Four weeks later and still nothing happening. And this is despite the fact that store admits the Froud and information shows I never got it,2018-01-30 12:54:47,Sablagh

I always make sure I read reviews and see picture before hand tho :) other than that it’s a really great place to buy cheap and good quality products. If ur on a budget this would be great,, sometimes it takes a while to come but don’t worry it’ll come ! Probably faster than the date they said it would come too !!",2022-11-28 21:59:34,anabhsbwbs
615,Ehhhh,False,3,The prices and selection of items are top notch and for the most part I've had great service and promptly delivered items (21 days) but that's coming from china or other places to here in the US...however the issue I have is when sellers don't deliver or ship products within stated time frames or dates and then customer service makes you negotiate with the seller for a discount or free expedited shipping since they are in the wrong and the seller never cooperates so after 10 days of a dispute Ali express steps in and arbitrates and even if they grant you a refund or partial refund it takes weeks for it to show ..took my money right away don't wanna give it back right away makes sense,2017-11-09 15:39:04,ic0nik1

Opted for a refund under the caveat that the item had to be returned. Item was returned but the seller put a different address on the return label so they can then claim they never got the item and keep the money and Aliexpress will cover them. Now because the seller put a bad address as the shipping address it would be returned to their courier system will hold the package for them to pick up. So they get to keep the money and the product and Aliexpress will condone this behavior and defend it.

So avoid clothing dealers on this site and know Aliexpress won’t support you. Ive had much better experiences on other apps.",2022-06-26 15:35:29,The Great Potoo

I’ve gotten leggings in the $12-15 range that are as good quality as my lululemons. So many kitchen gadgets, fairy lights, nail gels, office supplies, etc I’ve found on here. Overall, pretty pleasant experience and the majority of the clothes are decent quality as long as you check the reviews. Honestly love all the summer cotton dresses they sell. Lots of nice mom jeans/boyfriend jeans too.",2021-09-26 14:53:45,Ytrewqqa
621,Horrible customer service,False,1,I order multiples orders from them and never had an issue until I moved addresses. The sellers that ship and sell through AliExpress have bad communication with their buys. I order hair from luvin hair seller and it was shipped to the wrong address. We got in contact with fedex and sent evidence that the package was shipped wrong and instead of refunding me my 272 dollars they made me jump through hoops and never gave a real solution. They are now saying if they feel my evidence of my misplaced order isn’t valid they will refund the money to the seller and close the dispute. Why would AliExpress refund the money to the seller and not the buyer ? This app is a scam and I highly recommend using a different app that doesn’t cheat people out of their money.,2021-11-03 14:01:15,Valencia121
622,Die cuts from AliExpress,False,5,"I buy a lot of die cuts from AliExpress. If I ever have a problem with the die cuts not cutting well I send pictures and always get a refund immediately without having any problems and that doesn’t happen often. I really LOVE AliExpress and I recommend this amazing shop. All their products that I’ve bought and I bought a lot have been great. I have absolutely no regrets. I cannot recommend this shop highly enough. I hope you give AliExpress a try. You’ll love it as much as me. Sincerely, Andrea",2021-09-20 18:23:03,pooh-luver
623,Great App,False,5,"I have received every item I have ordered except 1. I do not like that the system automatically marks your item “received” once the guaranteed by date is reached because you only have 15 days to dispute after that. So I did lose $50. However, the amount of money I have saved has greatly surpassed $50. My guesstimate would be about $500 saved in the last 6 months. I would recommend that you read the item description VERY carefully and when buying clothes or shoes, pay very close attention to the measurements in the listing!",2019-12-14 06:10:48,itdmedmh
624,STAY AWAY! Don’t shop here.,False,1,"I have had very bad experiences with AliExpress. If you get your order and it’s what you were promised, then all is good. However, if something f is wrong. Good luck getting any help. They side with the seller over the customer and accused me of lying about a faulty product. Then, after you dispute a purchase, you’re not able to leave a review for the seller/product. Good way to weed out negative reviews and make the sellers look like they have some integrity. Don’t look here. The system is rigged to make it look like there’s a lot of happy customers and no problems. Also, when contact their online support, every time I expressed that I wanted to leave a review and couldn’t... suddenly there was a “network connection error with customer service” and it kicked me off.

625,IS IT WORTH THE WAIT?!?!?!?,False,3,"So.... Understandable items from China will take some time to receive, however 2-3 months is INSANE & honestly UNACCEPTABLE! There is NO REASON, even with COVID that an item should take 3 months to get to the USA! On top of the fact the Tracking info NEVER provides you with the correct information. You can NOT properly track items and then they end up “getting lost” at the local USPS office, THEN USPS never has any information about what is going on. Then when you finally receive an item....it’s a mini bottle, or REALLY POOR quality? So ask yourself; is it worth waiting 3 months to receive some cheaply made trinket that will end up breaking in a few days anyway?!!!?",2020-06-09 13:52:02,Nat0619
626,The aliexpress app beats the website 10 to 1,False,5,"It’s soooo much better and more intuitive and organized than using the website, if I had known that I would have downloaded it long ago. Even though the site is a Chinese retailer, the app has surprisingly great functionality — you can go to your orders and see if they’ve been paid or shipped or refunded very easily and the tracking for parcels updates easily too. Paying for items using multiple methods is way way easier as well. Would 100% recommend over the website",2019-02-26 03:57:22,cheddar whale

The seller didn’t reply me where to send back the merchandise and past the disputes day.  I didn’t hear any response for the return address for a long time.  AliExpress show I past disputes due day.  So, nobody will take care of my defects bag.

This makes me don’t want to order any items from AliExpress because there were no clear addresses to return.  When I bought the products online showed local free return, but when I contact seller and showed the defective product.  The seller never responded me and I don’t beside waiting for seller’s response what else I can do.  Then AliExpress showed it’s past disputes day and buyer didn’t return merchandise so the disputes complete.

Also before ordering I keep in mind that orders may take up to a month to receive depending on how it’s shipped so I’m always very happy when I comes within a week or two...

Example 1) I bought a choker( as I am a bit of an e-girl) and I received a call saying there was a 700 dollar transaction that needed to be confirmed and when I said no my card was locked.

Nope that’s not what happens. Sellers should have honest reviews, they don’t. If someone writes a good review for one item it shouldn’t be posted to other items the seller is selling. That’s called fraud. Because when you purchase something based off other people’s reviews then you get something totally different then what you wanted.

I mostly buy watch related items but sometimes little automotive or motorcycle items. Coffee/ kitchen accessories and the like. 

Using the app, It’s certainly not as polished as some others. Can be confusing, and the prices can be slightly misleading but that’s price issue is not of a function of the app but more the sellers.

 I’ve have overwhelmingly good experiences from buying on AliExpress and perhaps if I had encountered more negative I could give even better feedback. If you know what your doing, understand what to expect when buying directly from China, you can find lots of good stuff. 

If you compare to Wish your getting a lot more transparency. Wish is essentially a dumbed down- more streamlined way to buy from China (and a genius idea on their part), but I like AliExpress much better than DH gate or Wish.",2021-12-21 23:12:38,SB 85

653,Rarely do I rate,False,5,"I’ve been a fan of since 2013 and till this day, I still love this app! The only thing is they are constantly updating it. Deals are great if you find the right stores. Shipping is hit or miss because of the pandemic. 🗣 READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ANYTHING! Also look at the store rating. Would you eat at a restaurant with a score of 87 or below??? Same for Ali stores. I guess use your better judgment on it. lol other than that, 9/10 I recommend ✅

654,Overall a good app,False,5,"I love using AliExpress because I can always find things on there for cheap. Occasionally shops will pop up on my explore page via Instagram, showing me cute items. For example: there was one page that had a really cute phone case going for like... $23. But nevertheless, I managed to find the exact one on AliExpress for less than $3. 

The only con I can see is how long shipping may take sometimes. But I can somewhat forgive that seeing as a majority of the time the products are coming from China, and I live on the east coast in the United States.",2020-03-10 19:33:29,twice_stan1
655,Such a Great App,False,4,"This app has opened my eyes !! Thank god I found this app. I purchase literally almost everything here for my business. I really like how they add so much stuff on here, to keep us entertained. For example the little mobile games, earn points/coins, etc. they’re always updated this app which is great. Although, I liked the way the page was formatted before on the page to track your orders. And talking about tracking, I wish tracking would be more on track. I’m those type of people who like to know where everything is, but overall, great app, with so much potential!",2020-08-23 11:29:27,Kayloni/iHollow Graal
656,Best place to shop,False,5,"I shop around before I purchase anything. This is definitely one of the best places to shop if your looking for a deal and don’t mind a little long wait for your product. I have had nothing but a positive experience shopping here.  Even when I had a problem with an item it was handled quickly and professionally. Shopping here is cheaper and better than shopping eBay. Will definitely continue to shop here. Amazing prices and people.

Cons...be careful buying seeds here. Some of the sellers are not honest and send mustard or weed seeds.",2019-07-05 21:35:42,Shiningstar08
657,Cannot place orders. Customer service is awful,False,1,"Been trying to place orders for months now. They won’t accept any card I use and keep telling me to “file an appeal” - I’ve done that numerous times and the matter still isn’t resolved. The only way to get customer service is online chat and they don’t speak English very well. That’s fine though, the issue is that they don’t care - when they get sick of talking to you then just end the chat without notice so you get sent back to the start and nothing is resolved. They don’t do anything to help with any issue. I finally found a way to pay for some vendors using PayPal and after one day that stopped working too. Serious app and company issues and they have no care or intention to resolve any of the consumers issues.",2019-09-10 22:40:32,writeareview122
658,I actually recommend this app,False,5,"I thought it was a scam. I’m just a 16 year kid needing to buy stuff cheap for my personal project, building me a pc I actually received all my stuff under 20 days I thought I was gonna get scammed, but I’ll tell you this watch out and read carefully and make sure you look at the ratings and the sellers feedback and bots can’t be fooled so your fine. I personally think people where doing to much in the AliExpress feedback. Honestly try it for yourself just look at the sellers feedback and check for the orders on the sellers too! Overall nice!",2019-06-17 22:28:03,Adrian kyles
659,Love this site!,False,5,The best way to purchase things is to contact the sellers prior to paying if you have any questions. They are usually all very nice very accommodating and will give you correct information. Usually you can tell if they are being honest by the way they answer you and give information. I literally buy a lot of things here and have only gotten a few things that I didn’t like or that were not exactly as described in the titles but that was before I learned to communicate with the sellers first. Thank you for everything!,2019-03-30 07:48:57,Turtlebugable
660,"If AliExpress don’t have it, you don’t need it!",False,5,I seriously love this app/website and i tell everyone about it. I have never been disappointed with any orders i have made and received. They literally have just about anything you can think of and for a great price. Only friendly tip i have is just to be sure to read the description/specifications/size chart/and ESPECIALLY REVIEWS to be sure you are going to be satisfied with your purchase. don’t think twice about downloading the app !! it’s better than the website bc they offer mobile deals !!,2018-11-17 15:36:43,Phi'Royale
661,Aliexpress review,False,5,"My experience with this shopping site has been great, i have been shopping here since 2019 and some of my purchases did not make me happy, the quality being very low and bad material, but overtime i have learned reviews REALLY help to know what you are getting, pictures especially help me out so i can see the quality and see if i need to size up or down. Overall i really love this app and there are a lot of great purchases i have made! ^^ there will always be pros and cons ofc",2022-09-26 23:29:27,Avacado_Baby
662,Terrible return process,False,1,"The prices do look attractive but the return process is so difficult! I got an electronic product. It wasn’t working right and I thought it was just a defective battery and asked for a partial refund. However, weeks later after serval new batteries I got didn’t work either, I started to realize it is not the battery that had the issue, it is the electronic item itself that was defective. I contacted the seller but never got a response. I contacted AliExpress customer service many times, but they were just running in circles with me and never really helped. They are very irresponsible when things go wrong. I even tried to dispute with my cc company. Not sure why but disputing the AliExpress charge seems a lot more complicated than any dispute process I’ve ever seen.",2018-09-04 18:12:53,lian1hong11
663,Using an iPad Pro with Ali Express is terrible,False,1,"When using an iPad Pro with Ali Express it only offers portrait.  Landscape would make much more sense and would make it much easier and enjoyable to use.  When trying to contact App Support they ask to sign in.  When login in you’re asked to swipe right and that doesn’t work either so logging in is impossible also.  I tried the chat and after 20 minutes of explaining the problem, she then told me to answer the questions below:   Problem with an order not receieved, want a refund, etc, etc.   I asked her if those problems sound anything like what I’d been explaining for 20 minutes to her and she hung up the chat. So frankly my experience with AliExpress is horrible.",2022-09-27 12:54:55,rodan62052
664,They’ve come a long way!!!!!,False,5,"I can remember when AE wasn’t as user friendly or customer friendly. However, they’ve come a long way and the app is very similar to the SHEIN app with some obvious differences. The best feature for me is the ability to chat with a live agent. I’ve only had one dispute with a seller and we were able to resolve the issue without AE stepping in. This app is convenient for my lifestyle bc I am still able to do everything on the go that I can do on the desktop version.",2022-07-11 05:58:33,hungrytexasgal
665,Amazing!,False,5,I have been with AliExpress for months now and made several orders but I have never had any issues at all with loss of parcels or anything of such. I also enjoy their relatively low shipping cost and more often Free shipping to some countries. I just need them to improve their delivery times to my location then I should be good to go. Always remember to read REVIEWS rather than depending on their advertised pictures so your parcel doesn’t turn out to be a disappointment!😂 Amazing trade platform AliExpress!,2022-04-15 12:11:25,👑 DON
666,AliExpress Review,False,5,"I am mostly satisfied with the the service I’ve received from AliExpress over the years. 
I am a platinum member and they have always been cooperative and expedient with issuing refunds back to me whenever I’ve had to open a dispute because an order I made never arrived in the mail and/or did arrive but was damaged. 
The only complaint I would have is that I’ve noticed most items now include shipping charges, when in the past, most items came with free shipping. I find this to be quite disappointing because one of the reasons I’ve made so many orders with AliExpress was because of the free shipping along with very reasonable prices, which reminds me that I’ve also noticed that the prices on many of their items have also increased. 
I’d be curious to know why the increase in prices along with shipping charges. 
Thank you in advance for the great service, I look forward to a reply.

667,Great app so far no complaints,False,5,"Great app, no complaints.  I am a new user.  Spent a decent amount of money and first item from one seller arrived today, quite a few more to come.  We will see how quickly the items arrive during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The first package arrived ahead of schedule, even during the circumstances.  I chose free shipping on everything although each seller provides different options to choose from.  I am amazed at the deals I was able to find on gel nail polish, poly gels, brushes, lights, drill and design equipment.   Excited for the rest of my goods.",2020-05-28 04:32:00,MissGRRReen
668,Like to get great deals get this app!,False,5,"My friend I work with from Thailand told me she bought her work shirt from this app. She just told me the shipping takes along time about a month and in most cases it does. I like to order cheap little things like earrings and sunglasses. But I love this app it is exciting when I get packages because I order so many things I never know what I’ll
Be opening. How can you go wrong paying less than 5$ for earrings ! I usually spend less than 2! I tell everyone about this app I really enjoy it and buy a lot from them !",2019-10-23 16:20:52,Kaymmac
669,Love the Ali express app!,False,5,I spend hours on it every day!  I’d say it’s bad for my wallet but honestly it has saved me so much money.  When I see anything advertised on Instagram or Facebook I search for it here first and I find it guaranteed for a fraction of the price.  The down fall is the shipping time but that is no fault of the app.  I do wish however there was a way I could have more things on my wishlist (1000) and I can only have 100 things in my cart at a time.  I like to price shop and compare items etc and limiting my cart and wish list limits that,2019-07-11 04:10:31,Markellys
670,Broken app and website,False,1,"You would think that a company worth billions will spend some effort on building a smoothly running app and website. I dread shopping on Ali express and never do it unless I have to order something for my family abroad. The products are great and cheap but both the app and the site frustrate me. I don’t remember I’ve ever had a single order where the ordering went smooth. On the website, after browsing a few products, I get an error regarding cookies stuck in a loop. On the app, the payment got flagged and I was asked to upload pictures, but the pictures simply won’t upload and I got frustrated and gave up. I’m sure they’re losing a lot of business because of this but probably don’t care since they’ve made a lot of money already.",2019-09-17 18:59:05,doctorsmonsters
671,Great!,False,5,"I love Ali express, but I don’t understand why some sellers take over a week to send the items, making the time of waiting , super long. Others send the items quickly and I get them in United States in a week or ten days, while with others I am still waiting for over two months. There has to be something that can be done in this regard. I find awesome things and want to keep on buying here, but hope they will fix the issue of shipping. I love it otherwise. Thanks.",2022-10-26 03:50:51,Mary Gatica

After over 100 purchases I only had one issue, which has been resolved already! I recommend this App, prices are much lower than anywhere else, Shipping varies between 2 weeks and a few months, depending on item and seller.

673,Experience with purchase,False,5,"I’m a hundred percent satisfied with the purchase of model wooden sailing ships. The directions are perfectly fine requiring very little time to interpret parts placement, construction glues, tools required to complete the assembly with extremely high detail And tolerance for completion. I’m a little more experienced I feel and I’m very confident in the process of construction process and procedures.

674,Aliexpress app,False,4,"I’m quite obsessed with Aliexpress. They are correct w both the sellers and the buyers.  First  thing I definitely give cons is when you don’t receive your order but you have NO idea why, there is no chance to say only you didn’t receive it.  You MUST “ tell “ why. Who knows??? I just would like to receive what I ordered. The other cons is lately they are sending in one package your several orders. That part is okay.

675,Needs More Folders,False,5,"I love the app as it is; only problem I have with the app is that it’s setting to make another folder on saving a item you want to buy later makes it difficult to search in some of my folders to find the specific item that I saved for later. Wish app has this option, I would like see the same options for AliExpress to have more folders to hold specific items instead of limited to 5 to 6 folders",2021-12-22 18:58:53,K.K1999

I would recommend y’all to get this hair it’s very nice and the unit is so cool..%100 person human hair and could last for long and you can color it and do whatever you want to do with the hair it doesn’t break out..

677,Hard to find items found,False,5,"I love using AliExpress, I’m glad I found it, it is a lot of figures I didn’t know where out there, and a lot of figures that aren’t out there anymore, at a reasonable price. I have been satisfied with the items I have purchased, now one item recently not so much, the actual item in the box was fine, but the box itself was trashed, and I’m a collector that doesn’t take figures out the box. Overall I am satisfied with AliExpress, and will keep using it here on out.",2021-10-06 20:33:53,FigrHunter
678,Annoying cart set up!,False,2,I hate that there is a limit to what you can buy and then you have to individually click and delete your cart instead of being able to slide and erase an item! It’s annoying! Shipping is always too far out! Great deal but for the hassle is it worth it! I’m a small business owner and I look for real to supply my business with and my business would suffer due to their inefficient service! I will stick to personal purchases of 1 or 2 things! Shameful that I will be again deleting the app! Also it’s annoying that the search results never match what you enter! Take the time to fix the app to make it user friendly!,2021-10-10 20:56:39,Neffi D'Qween
679,Love it!,False,5,"I have been purchasing from this APP for years. I just love it! The deals are great. Shipping takes a while, but the price is worth it. The app has great features like previous purchases and you can communicate with the sellers. You can also search for items and there is a new feature where you can take a picture of the item you’re looking for. It’s pretty dope! The app also holds my items in my cart until I order them, or remove them. Love that feature!! I am on this APP almost everyday looking for good deals!",2020-09-29 18:16:23,Heather795
680,AliExpress is great app!! Just make sure you look over sellers first!,False,5,"Great app and easy to use! Has everything from radio controlled fun to clothes. Just make sure to look over sellers before buying & browse carefully. Some things like watches, TVs, & electronic stuff will be fakes, so be careful what you buy. AliExpress is just the middle company between you & the sellers, so you wont get scammed by the app or company itself, but sellers will try to sell you fake stuff through the app. If you are careful & know what to buy, this app works great & I highly recommended it to people I know!",2020-04-29 19:50:49,This is a very good app!
681,Well organized and easy to navigate,False,4,"This APP is very well put together and maintained well. Now I’m not sure all the products listed are legitimate as some high value brands of consumer electronics are listed and are too cheap to be legitimate. 
But, there is a very large selection of products covering all categories. 
Ordered once and was never able to track my package with the websites and tracking number furnished. I tried to reach out to customer support but could not find a way to contact them. This is a major flaw and the avenues to contact customer support should be very easy to find.",2020-07-15 23:17:46,mwcouch
682,Highly addictive!!,False,5,"Ali express is an app that I visit the most everyday more than any social media! It’s definitely addictive I should say because it’s a huge stress buster for me to do “online window shopping!!” And ofcourse sometimes actually shopping !! I add atleast 2 items each day to my cart and the moment my cart reaches its limit, I reduce it by buying the items that I lived the most in the cart! It’s definitely affordable and more cheaper compared to any other online shopping websites and the best part is it can be shipped easily to any part of the world!",2018-08-03 18:20:36,jaskvshw

I contacted with the support and the seller,both cannot reach out for the local post office and I need to go to the local post office by my own. It took charges for transportation and time at there for item wasn’t delivered,finally I got my order,in the end,the order is charged more money than it’s mentioned on shopping site including shipping fees and took time to get my delivery out course of the fault of service provider’s sender error.",2019-01-14 10:36:54,AN Chang 101
684,Horrible Customer Service and Buyer Protection,False,1,"First of all, let me start by saying there are scammers on this platform, Specifically Wow-Fashion. Be careful when sellers offer epacket delivery (which is the fastest , 12-20 days), especially when they offer it free because they may scam u like Wow-Fashion and ship it China post which takes forever. When you contact customer service about it they cease to condemn or reprimand these seller scams and redirect you to report these frauds only to get your support ticket denied because they “didn't violate policy”. Yes, basically AliExpress defends scammers. So buy at your own risk and dont expect timely delivery for products u may need ASAP through epacket because there is no buyer protection period. Ive never had this problem, i went in thinking i could trust them but now Im infuriated.",2018-12-13 20:54:11,Time to keep fit
685,Guilty pleasure,False,5,"I used to love another similar app, but their prices suddenly skyrocketed and if you bought multiple products from the same store they would charge separate shipping (even if all the products came in one package). I’m so happy this app honors one shipping price per store and they are incredibly responsive to any questions or concerns. If you happen to have a negative experience with a seller, you can count on this company to have your back. So far so good. Very happy with the app so far.",2022-11-01 16:19:19,Leforna
686,AliExpress,False,5,I absolutely love AliExpress! I’ve been shopping with them for many years now! I’ve never had to send anything back. I read the reviews to know when to size up or down. I haven’t had a problem with the quality of any clothing that I’ve purchased. Communication with the sellers have been great. And I greatly appreciate using their products for my Boutique! I am a lifetime customer of AliExpress! Thank you guys for everything and you’re highly recommended to all my friends!,2021-06-10 15:08:43,Pretty Tee'
687,I love this app,False,4,It’s affordable and as long and you look at the reviews for the most part (at least 98% of everything I’ve bought) has come with no issues or backlash! Not everything will match the description to a tea but you get what you pay for and I’ve bought so many things from here! The shipping takes a while (1-3 months!) but like I said it’s dirt cheap!! I don’t regret buying from here and I definitely won’t stop anytime soon! I’ve definitely bought over 100 items and I’ve had this app for a under a year!,2021-08-14 21:54:19,amaterasu_357
688,Risky,False,2,"I’ve ordered about 200 things from here and most went well but some things took one to three months to arrive and a few never came. When that happens you have dispute the order and wait months to get a refund. I dunno if it’s the shipper or something else. Some orders will say “Shipment ready for dispatch” and go no further while others disappear in customs. That said, these deals aren’t worth it. Each deal is a risk and in my opinion the headaches outweigh the deals. Don’t forget, orders from China are probably “AS IS” or “NO WARRANTY” and you’ll be stuck with whatever. Some of the Chinese orders will show up in your mailbox and look like they’ve been hit by a truck.",2021-06-28 19:58:18,dphillip
689,Been using for a few years now,False,5,You’re shopping blind so keep expectations low but I have found some gems for the cheaper pricing. I’m from the States so delivery time is usually around a month from order. Expect products to be about two sizes smaller so if you usually order a Medium you will want to go with an Extra Large. Handy app and I have ordered a lot of birthday and Christmas gifts from it. Just be sure to order about 6 weeks ahead to make sure you get it on time.,2021-03-19 17:11:43,Pop-corn13
690,"Very useful, though navigation is unfriendly",False,3,"The app makes shopping on AliExpress easier, but the navigation needs work. Example: Freebie reviews allow you to type 30minutes of text and photos, but if you try go “back” to see the instructions, it throws it all away without warning.

It also is very poor about targeting sales to your needs. It spends a lot of bandwidth trying to sell me dresses and other women’s clothing and very little time on the men’s shoes, shorts, and electronics that I’m interested in. Sorry, but I have no intention to EVER buy a dress, yet it never learns. 

Reminds me of the days that men would turn off the TV when they couldn’t handle being bombarded by feminine hygiene commercials.

Ironically, be careful not to accidentally click on something you don’t want. Although it won’t let you say what you don’t want, it is very quick to show you alternatives for years to things you do click on, even after you bought one and don’t need another.",2021-04-07 02:23:10,Dash 42
691,Great app!!!,False,5,I have ordered many things from the app and only had a few little issues which were taken care of promptly. I would advise people to try it out but do your homework and check the items and sellers ratings when choosing to place any order! I would also advise to use Ali shipping because it is the best way to track your items. Always read reviews on the items! It really helps so that you know exactly what you are getting.,2022-09-25 14:11:54,Sillyphilly1215
692,break very easily and not good quantity product,False,1,"have many years using this app and I think is great on many ways. But there is something that you will notice and that is the products here are getting more expensive and the material the quantity of the product are getting weak or smaller.   I notice that all the items here are like toys for children not for grownups because they break easily and they are tiny small .... I don’t like this app like I use to like it. And there are many others apps that have the same items around here and I don’t use them... price getting more expensive and not good product they break I buy items that cost 1-1,000 they just get higher price items and they don’t care for the quantity... that is what I was saying thank you",2018-05-18 12:30:59,i use to like this app
693,Just started using,False,5,"So far good using the app! Easy to see how many and what the cost is. This app is very User friendly! I order on here more then wish or DHG! Because it’s easy to how much your spending and if there is shipping. No sneaky sgipping charges! UPDATE: Love this app.. I use it a lot! Good prices, no hidden shipping fees.
Update:
Still using this app! Saves money on my little things. You do have to wait for product but you just have to learn to keep a flow coming in if it’s something you use a lot.",2022-05-28 18:20:54,Nutbutt11
694,Highly recommended,False,5,"I’ve made 4 purchases and 1 refund (items were out of stock). I’ve not had any issues. I recommend using PayPal to make purchases for an additional layer of security and fraud protection. Keep in mind that the packaging can take a beating during the shipping process, but the product has never been damaged. Shipping time is very unpredictable. I usually receive the items before I get reliable tracking updates. I’ve been satisfied with every purchase.",2022-02-11 23:55:13,GunplaCI
695,Customer Satisfaction,False,5,I’m overall pleased with the service of Ali Express. They stand behind their products and they make there application easy and user friendly. The vendors are able to reply instantly. When I’ve had a problem with a vendor Ali stood behind there policies and responded appropriately with a reasonable solution and money back guarantee. The only suggestion I have is a coupon should apply to the over all price of your total and not based upon each vendors coupon offer.,2021-01-14 03:27:16,vonchelle
696,Love it but I have some “ideas”,False,4,So the app is great 👍 lots of good stuff and all but…. (DRAMATIC PAUSE) I really wish you could buy more than one thing at a time now I have to buy it go back to the cart buy something else go back to the cart (I have 25 things in my cart so that’s gonna take forever) that’s really annoying to have to go back and forth so that’s why I gave it four stars ⭐️ if the developer updated this I would give this a 5/5 but right now it’s a 4/4 and I really really hope you see this and update it keep up the good work 👍 😌,2021-09-14 23:21:37,TheRealReviewer <3
697,Pretty good price for what you get.,False,5,I’d give it 5 starts but about 1 in every 10 items never arrives soooooo. At least they’re very good at giving you your money back when it happens. You just have to wait a long time to open dispute. Other than that I am super happy with the quality of some things along with the prices. Best part is that they always encourage you to leave a review. That way you can see what other people are saying about a product you’re interested in so you know you’re getting a good product.,2019-12-06 04:01:39,_sentifer_
698,Almost the best app,False,3,I liked this app because almost all my orders were complete until lately that couple of my orders looked that were lost on the way and didn’t received them and contacted costumer service and didn’t get my money back. This is very disappointing this is the first site that didn’t give me my money back for a not received order. One of this orders the seller said that was sent and delivered I never got it and I lost my money. The other I know it was shipped separate but never got a tracking number and now I’m afraid I will loss my money again. Now I’m not sure if order more stuff if occasionally I will not receive my order.,2020-09-28 01:27:38,73Gabgab
699,APP Review,False,4,"I was chosen to review this app. I think that a good number of your stores are helpful but quality control or products and packaging methods could use improvement. I use multiple platforms not only this one, If I was treated as the loyal customer I am... I would be more loyal to THIS PARTICULAR APP. I hope that you’re team sees this and raises my status or does something that recognizes the money that I continue and potentially continue to spend my time and money, IF treated better... current customer service has not been 100% BETTER PADDING/ PACKAGING FOR SHIPPING & better consistently in the products quality and sizing",2020-08-09 09:16:14,BobbyBOOKS
700,This app is AMAZING,False,5,"The first thing I got off of here was this extremely cute skirt, and ever since then I’ve been buying NON STOP. I love that you can find so much clothing, skin care items, and ect for such a low price with great quality. A lot of the products you won’t even see in your regular stores, so people will be all up on you askin you “hunty where chu got that cute shirt from” and you gon be like “as if I’m giving up my precious style info to you” and then you gonna strut outta that place like a queen baby!! Anyways, to sum it up, this app is the bomb with a tripple dot com 💓💓",2018-04-01 18:37:23,Lpscute9
701,Just Get Wish,False,2,"Don’t use AliExpress unless you’re not afraid of losing money. Orders will get randomly closed due to “security reasons” with no way of getting your item or money back. Customer services are terrible because a useless bot replies. You can contact the seller, but you’ll be lucky if they actually reply with a real person. One of the sellers I tried to contact just ignored my messages and the other replied with a message saying “your order has been on the road. We hope you can wait patiently.” I waited a month and then decided to try and ask for an update or something and the same message was sent to me. Luckily, the items only added up to around $1 but I really wanted a cute necklace and pen.",2019-03-28 13:28:06,ThotContagion
702,Works Well and....(Updated),False,5,".....display is the size of a small smartphone screen which is frustrating on my 10.5” tablet.  If it was made to fit screen size I’d easily give it 5 stars for convenience and ease of navigation!

Update:  They’ve made it full screen now.  Thank you!

Reminder:  98% of the sellers are wonderful but as with anything involving people there are a few not-so-scrupulous ones.  AliExpress support is wonderful about fixing such issues.  (The only Asian dropship company I trust.)",2022-11-19 15:10:26,Milyvan1
703,Love Ali,False,5,I love Ali so much I buy everything from there from clothes to posters to random items you name it . Everything is always so less expensive then if it were to sell in another online app. Especially the goth clothes. You can get a skirt for 20$ on here and for the same exact one people sell in other online stores is like 80$. Even tho the items may take a month to get there it’s really worth it and saves you so much money. Dunno what I would do without this app,2022-08-02 14:34:28,Tali🖤
704,AMAZINGGG,False,5,Love love love this app I will admit that I was a bit nervous about ordering from here at first. But I totally do not regret downloading this app the things are at an amazing price and really good quality. Just like any other app always look at reviews first.  I really enjoy Ali express and it has a wide variety of things to buy. I also like how you can earn coupons and communicate with the seller directly. Returns or negotiations are fairly easy. All in all this is one of my favorite apps to online shop.,2021-11-02 17:55:24,acm560
705,A great multivariety shopping app,False,5,"There are literally thousands of items sold on this app by all types of sellers. There are rating systems for each product and seller and store, and you can also follow stores you like which have products that interest you. There is a dispute process in place for when a user receives damaged goods or do not receive goods at all, very protective for the buyer overall. I enjoy buying from this app a lot as there is a lot of free shipping for small items as well.",2021-07-24 18:41:50,hokagayyy
706,Review,False,5,"I am very happy and satisfied with many stores.
I am not satisfied with the platform that takes care of disputes. I disputed some masks that said N95 and got sent the wrong product only 1 layer. Product was distributed as having layers and it was totally wrong and you didn’t help even when I sent evidence. I have lost faith in you totally. I know now that you will only defend the store and not protect the customer.
I would like to get it reviewed again but I know you closed it. We are on our own.",2020-12-05 18:19:56,G & Q 4 Less
707,Fun,False,5,I love AliExpress. I’ve been using them for many years. I recently rediscovered them and spend hours on the app just window shopping the word and wonderful catalog. It’s got everything from realistic silicone feet to anime clothes and household goods. I’ve ordered a lot of stuff from them and have yet to be disappointed. Just be sure to check the size conversion on clothes! A lot of the clothes are in tiny Asian sizes. Also know that it will take weeks or months if you order from China not the USA (if you’re in the US) because of customs and whatnot.,2020-10-06 18:17:18,Cryssie83
708,AWESOME,False,5,"I just wanted to take the time to let others know that this seller is completely awesome!!! I ordered this for my daughter for her very first sew in! My oldest has ordered from this seller before and said i wouldn’t be disappointed!!! Well she was absolutely correct!!! It arrives in a timely matter and the hair was perfect texture and all! She took the time to stay in contact with me until my product arrived!! That’s personal and it’s shows she takes pride in her services and products!! I will me referring her to all my friends!!!

  So far I've been good friendship with this AliExpress a few months more for decade,every little things I need I get it .we connect by orders and sender;buyer n ' sellers by mail,email to get messages go on,used words for business and never see the other,since I've known AliExpress I always want more and more

710,Hopefully you never have to deal with customer service,False,3,"Customer service is awful and there are a few bad apples among the merchants. I had one that sent me a broken cable when I proposed a refund they messaged me telling me to mark the order as received as described and that AliExpress staff would then refund me. Obviously they were lying so I didn’t go through with it and spoke to customer service who after a very lengthy pointless back and forth suggested I drive into town and mail the cable back for a refund. Mind you this cable was under $3 so it was not worth my time even through the lens of a sunk cost fallacy. 

Outside of that goods are really affordable",2019-11-24 20:44:51,Yosef808
711,LOVE THIS APP!!!,False,5,"I love how you can take extra precautions that you have indeed received your product. I have used this app for buying presents for friends and family. However, I have only one minor issue. I have a wishlist, and I didn’t know there was a limit to it. I usually add all the goodies I ordered before on the list, so I know to always order from that specific seller again, if need be. But my wishlist is already full!! Please include a limitless wishlist in the new update!! Overall, I love this app, and the only inconvenience is the limit on the wishlist.",2019-01-31 20:15:02,Kuro_Angel143
712,One for three,False,1,"I ordered from three different sellers in late November 2018; one package arrived on time (one item was damaged, but I could sew it back up) and the others never came, but somehow the orders show as being fulfilled on the app. I’d received a notification that the packages, which were due to arrive Dec. 12th, would be a month or more late—useless since they were Christmas gifts. I figured I’d recycle them for birthdays or something, though, so didn’t cancel the orders. Looks like I should have. I tried to cancel one of them recently, but haven’t heard anything since and couldn’t do anything on the other. I was willing to accept the risk that the items would take longer to ship than stated, but didn’t expect AliBaba would take my money without delivering anything.",2019-02-05 13:07:07,riskofdefects
713,Great site!!,False,5,"This is absolutely a fantastic site to buy from!! Have been a customer for approximately 3-4 years and have NEVER been disappointed in anything I’ve purchased, no matter what it is! I’ve purchased shoes, pocketbooks, clothes and even as inexpensive as kitchen tools and have always been happy! They are really good about delivering items before or in the time frame they give. Always try to find what I want from them first before looking anywhere else! 😊",2022-09-28 22:55:29,CindiGH
714,Amazing shopping experience!,False,5,"There are so many things to choose from!  I am in shopping “heaven”!  Items sometimes take a couple of months to get here but are well worth the wait.  I have been shopping with them for several years now and  have only had a couple of glitches, which they have quickly addressed to my satisfaction.  This app has made it so easy to shop, and offers just about everything you can imagine!",2022-07-02 16:13:53,Rhienzi5463
715,"This site is addicting, but in a good way!",False,5,"I can’t brag enough about AliExpress. The deals I have gotten are well worth the wait for the items. 
I have purchased from a couple of sellers that didn’t send the merchandise but Aliexpress quickly made good for it by issuing a refund. They did so without me even requesting it with one seller due to tracking being invalid. 
I am consistently on the site. To a fault!  
I love Aliexpress for purchases for my VR accessories and adult novelties. You just can’t beat the prices.",2022-04-27 19:10:02,Mickeya31
716,Awesome,False,5,This is one of my favorite apps. It’s awesome the variety of products they have. I’ve been shopping with them for almost year and they they are have yet to disappoint. They craft items they offer our great. We were really tight on money this Christmas (who wasn’t right?) and I found the best things to make presents and my family loved what I created. Probably more than ‘regular’ presents I would normally get. Thanks AliExpress for helping me make Christmas presents a possibility this year. 🎁 🎄🧑‍🎄❄️🍪🥛🌌,2022-04-04 11:34:37,Jkop9
717,Great !,False,5,"Despite all negative feedbacks I have heard from some people and even though my wife ordered some stuff and didn’t get it, I can’t complain for the operation and 100% reliability on my purchases with Ali Express,they have been very respectful and professional,the sellers communicated with me very fast and clearly, and many of the products arrived earlier than expected, so I appreciate the good services and business of this promising Corporation. Thank you and I encourage them to keep up this way!",2022-02-10 17:20:39,Blue0472
718,Meh,False,2,"So the app functions well, the algorithm isn’t bad. The app does do weird updates though, and someone being skeptical could see these as red flags. Make sure to pay attention to the processing time listings, more often than not, if it says it’s shipping from US, it’s still coming from abroad.

Example: Ordered a device they said was in the US. The seller ran out the processing time, printed the label and it still hasn’t shipped. Ordered 3/9/22, “shipped” 3/16 and today is 3/18 (5pm) and USPS still does not have the item. Stuff like this seems common on there. Kinda sad and not a great experience. Have 2 stars cause it’s not Ali’s fault, but they have no way to keep sellers accountable either.",2022-03-18 21:33:27,TheFirstMarkTheSecond
719,AMAZING AMAZING!!,False,5,"aliexpress is amazing with so many items you could browse- all it takes is for you to search it up! aliexpress also has soooo many cheap items for very good quality too! 
many complain that aliexpress has sellers who scam A LOT, well your job as an online shopper is to research the reviews and ratings like crazy. and if there’s very few reviews, you might likely wanna stay away from it. 

definitely love aliexpress, will be purchasing a lifetime of supplies there in the future!! <3",2021-11-14 00:43:35,vieta21
720,I LOVE AliExpress!!,False,5,"I can’t not give this app enough credit! Amazing products that are also good quality! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve found the exact same items in a boutique that I found on AliExpress for more than triple the cost cheaper! All the shops are professional and have always worked on any errors I’ve encountered! I have been using AliExpress consecutively for 2 years and I will never shop another wholesale app again. 

10/10 Stars 
Highly Recommend!",2021-08-23 04:05:30,TheProverbs31Mama
721,Ali pop!,False,5,"Sometimes it takes forever to receive orders, but if your not in a hurry there are great deal! Especially on men’s underwear which has been my main purchases. Underwear styles that are $20-$30 dollars here in America  are less than $6 bucks through AliExpress. I’ve also purchased wall art, light effect strips/ropes so far I’ve been very happy. A little slow, but I understand it’s coming from Asia and there is customs and other processes not usually seen in the American market.A++++
4 stars!!",2021-01-19 00:54:36,groovebone
722,HAPPY CUSTOMER,False,5,This website makes me feel secure about shopping with wholesale vendors. I have a project going that will require many more purchases. They have a good system that keeps you updated with all your purchases. So far all of my items have arrived way sooner than expected. They give you a month to receive them but it was less than 2 weeks. I feel good knowing they are always updating my purchase to the best of their knowledge. Thank you for the service you offer to make my purchases successful.,2019-07-22 13:16:03,Marlene DJ
723,Hit or total miss!,False,1,"I hate to down talk any business but Allie express is horrible, hit or totally miss! As Ive had the cite/app for years now I do tend to buy things from it here & there. I’ve had 2 items I liked and the rest of the purchase were completely different from the description, some clothing items came torn, different materials than describe (thin, very easy to rip)I purchased 4 body chains 5 months ago and I’ve contacted and continue to contact the seller. There unresponsive, I just receive computerized messages that have nothing to do with the things I’ve asked or say. 
  This is a very poor company whom really catches your eye don’t fall for it ! Every item LOOKS flawless, it’s a different site in person.",2021-01-05 18:55:50,ashaaaaaaaboooooooooooq
724,Great products.,False,4,I love the app. Be careful and make sure you hound the sellers because if I don’t stay on top of some of them my items never come. It’s good and bad. I wish that they would verify customers. To make sure they are shipping out items and when they don’t I’d like for them to be banned. I got a lot of stuff off this site however. Stuff takes a while but it’s worth it sometimes. I currently have about 6 orders waiting to get through customs. Shipping may be even longer bc of Covid. So make sure you order MONTHS ahead of time.,2020-12-05 05:30:28,Starlord3000
725,Be certain of your purchases!!!,False,3,"Shopping on AliExpress is fun and easy. In fact it’s too easy to fill your cart to the limit with all the great stuff you can find. HOWEVER, be really certain you want that item before you purchase it because shipping is haphazard and the refund policies are difficult at best. You have to really stay vigilant if you have a dispute because you may miss your cue via email if you don’t check frequently.
AND it’s rather expensive if you have to return something to China! Try to find your item from a store that offers free refunds if you have ANY doubts.
All that said, my cart is still always full! Ciao!",2020-10-07 17:51:23,Ddwmitch
726,AliExpress takes way too long,False,1,"I’ve purchased thousands of dollars of products from AliExpress and lately I have been let down because of the tremendously long shipping time. I will limit what I purchase from now on because it took 3 months to get an order. If AliExpress backed the products shipping time I would continue to do business with them but they don’t. I submitted a dispute over the extreme amount of time for shipping and they allowed it to happen. Yes, I finally got the items but I am choosing not to purchase anything else due to AliExpress’s choice to not support the purchaser. It shouldn’t take 3 months for anything to ship in this world right now. eBay and other sites can provide what I purchase within days not months for about the same price.",2020-07-26 20:43:46,Nwlpotceacesrgat
727,Amazing,False,5,"I was pretty skeptical of this app at first. I was recommended it from a friend and at first glance it appeared to be nothing more than fake stuff straight from China. While most products here are from China, you can fond really good quality stuff as long as you look at the reviews and photos from buyers. Not to mention it’s cheap! Best advice is to just look carefully at reviews before buying something and expect shipping to take up to a month. I’d say it’s pretty worth it though. Overall I love it, and I’ve ordered multiple times from here!",2018-12-09 09:50:05,EpicAnyonmous
728,One of the best apps I’ve ever used.,False,5,Beautiful application with easy to understand features and just as good as the webpage. The programmers did a wonderful job it’s even better than some of the major and famous US online stores. However there is one thing that could be hanged if possible..  in the searching tool when sorting the items searched for by price it does not include shipping cost to the total price . Therefor the cheapest one might not be the cheapest when u include shipping .. it that could change it will safe me a lot of time,2018-05-30 20:18:36,iMonsterette
729,Interesting & fun! Win merchandise play games! & shop!,False,5,"I am addicted to the AliExpress app! It’s so much more than what you get from the website using a pc or laptop! 
It’s like a completely different store! 
You get to play games, win coin to buy items & get coupons... there is freebies (apply every day for free items) & contests for all kinds of goodies! Plus you save money on all your purchases!
Why anyone would not want to use this app is unbelievable to me! 
Try it it’s real fun! Plus you have absolutely nothing to loose & only plenty to win/gain!",2018-01-26 18:24:09,robin_Loves2shop
730,Better Than Expected,False,5,"I was a little hesitant using this app to buy anything, but not after my first purchase was received.  I got plenty of notifications about item status, and the items came much quicker than expected.  The initial deliver dates where at least a month out, but I received fishing tackle still in time for this year.  Prices were good, shipping prices were reasonable, and delivery times weren’t long.  Can’t do much better than that.",2022-11-02 17:35:32,Eaglep758
731,Great products at outstanding prices!,False,5,"I have been shopping AliExpress for several years now and I find I can get just about any item for less than half the cost of getting it from the U.S.!

My only issue is that shipping is often lengthy so plan far enough ahead of time to get gifts and such.",2022-10-06 22:35:51,Joya1954
732,Best marketplace for everything,False,5,"I use Ali express to buy items from people who have great items that may not be able to support themselves as a big business or maybe are advertised like.

Out of the 50+ orders I’ve made, about 5 had some issues which were mainly sellers sending me wrong items or forgetting to send one of the items.

I recommend if you're looking for cheap dupes, I buy all my nail art supplies (rhinestones, acrylics, glitter, press-ons), individual lashes, hair accessories etc. on aliexpress they have so many vendors and options, Also the rewards/coupon feature is a fun way to save a little $$, Also Please remember aliexpress is AN APP, if you have an issue with the individual seller then thats the seller dont give the app a bad review because you experienced a bad seller!",2021-06-21 03:43:07,mr pancakess
735,Came from wish to this app.,False,5,This is my new buyer lol. Good for my figure collection because they don’t usually have shipping fee. Or most time they don’t which is good and their price is good deal. I don’t buy electronic from this store for I have local store for that but overall other things for collection are on point. Check the seller for feedback before buying but so far my items have reach me with no problem. Been only using this app for the past 3 month.,2021-03-24 02:10:58,TruthFact59
736,Some problems,False,5,"I have always enjoyed using the app, but now I’m experiencing something which I have never encountered before with the app. I tried to add product to my cart, but it somehow was not shown in the cart and I tried multiple times.  Another problem is, when I refreshed the cart page, the items that were previously added there were removed (I didn’t click to remove, the app did it itself). Please fix it soon. Thank you :)",2021-03-17 01:22:03,McQueen-MJ
737,Love it. Plain & simple.,False,5,"I’m glad I found out about this app. I’m surprised I never came acrross it sooner. It’s organized, easy to use and all the sellers are patient and very friendly. Not to mention the best prices you’re gonna find anywhere. Plus there’s so much diversity between some of the items, that you might even leave with something new that you hadn’t even planned on buying. I can’t say enough good things about this company. Just know it’s worth a stop even if it’s just to check all these things out. 👍 👍",2020-08-14 20:00:12,\cP/
738,Great website slow delivery,False,5,"I have ordered many things from different vendors all have been good quality.
I receive them slowly but am very satisfied with the products 
it is best to do your research before buying as many of the sellers are only distributors and can’t provide real technical assistance.
I have had a few issues and the sellers seem to be responsive to refunds for reasons they feel are valid. If you get into a technical issue you will probably be out of luck which happened twice to me",2020-04-15 02:02:12,Kings canyon

740,Great app stand behind the customer,False,5,Thanks so muchI was a level five I am a level five I need the hg gates and I haven’t used them in months because they do not stand behind their customer and they have nothing but really bad sellers bait and switch and all kinds of things and you stand behind your customer and you really don’t have a lot of them are bait and switch on this app once in a while I get something because I buy a lot!! But u take care of it thanks ally express,2021-12-05 00:04:34,god1jesusev
741,Good but could use improvements,False,3,"Overall, the app is good but there are a few things that would make it so much better! First, when you’re browsing around or search for something, there’s no easy way to return to the home page. You have to keep hitting the back arrow over and over and over again. Also, searches bring up items completely unrelated to what you’re looking for, even when you’re search is quite detailed. Making these features better would make me enjoy the app and shopping on the site much more.",2022-09-21 00:08:13,StompyBoo
742,Great Customer Service,False,5,"This is a great app if your looking for good deals. Yes it does take a little long to recieve your item but it is coming from over seas. It has to go threw customs before it gets to the states and probably again once it gets to the states. Which to me is no big deal. Also if anything is wrong with your item Customer Service will stick up for you to make sure you're item gets fixed, replaced, per refunded if nessacary ! I definatly recommend.",2021-04-17 02:35:11,Kevindesireecraven06
743,Aliexpress is more worth it than you think.,False,5,"Even if the product you buy is “cheap”, I, personally have never had a bad experience buying from this app. All you need to do is make sure you read reviews and make sure the shop you’re buying from is legitimate. Yes, it will take time for your product to arrive because most of the time it’s coming from a different country but I have never had a package not arrive. Love this app and always will.",2021-02-25 02:19:51,twiggbishh
744,Too many bad sellers,False,3,I’ve ordered many items since I am just opening my online boutique. Out of 20+ pieces I was only happy with about 5. It is very difficult to find good quality items because sellers use other shops photos and not enough of their own photos. Therefore quality is almost never as expected. Also many of the seller I tried returning to made it difficult to exchange or get a refund. Not sure I will continue to buy my supplies from here since prices are not even cheap enough. Have found some of the same items in the US and cheaper price.,2021-03-04 18:45:50,S*****C
745,Makes Wish look like garbage.,False,5,"This app is much better than other alternatives. It’s easy to use. You can cancel orders immediately if you place them in error. The advertising is minimally intrusive and is easy to get around. It also give you options for different warehouse locations (if multiple) from which to ship your items, so you can pick and choose which country you would like to get products from to minimize shipping time. Great app. I’ll be using this a great deal in the future.",2020-10-19 21:43:00,Cessna928
746,I love love LOVE AliExpress!,False,5,"In all honesty, if I could give this app more than a 5/5 stars, I would. This app is my go-to app to shop on. The prices are incredibly low that I'll usually spend 10 dollars on like 20 things. You can find ANYTHING on this app for a low price. The only thing I could say about this app is that if you're the type of person who likes things to arrive the next day, then this app in not for you. Things take a while for them to arrive but it doesn’t bother me at all! Thank you for such an amazing app!!!!",2020-08-13 01:37:48,Jung Ana
747,Needs improvement for Covid-19,False,5,"After the arrival due date for the item  is reached, the item goes into a feedback queue. If the item hasn’t arrived by the date promised (especially likely now during the pandemic) and you don’t dispute the transaction, you’re likely to miss the window for a refund. 
Tracking numbers can give you a “Completed” response and your item has yet to arrive. Not sure how to improve this but these are concerns for both buyers and sellers.",2020-05-09 07:14:41,Auntie Sandy
748,Wholesale prices with lots of options,False,5,"Great prices, love that there’s options for shipping if you want to get items faster. The search is relevant and you can find just about anything. I love that there’s reviews on almost everything and that the different sellers offer different coupons and you have the option to message the sellers directly from the app and from my over a year experience seem to be rather consistent and good description of products and sellers are engaged with the consumer.",2019-09-13 23:35:38,really070722
749,It’s like any insta boutique but at low prices.,False,5,"If you find the right stuff, and learn how to size the clothing accordingly (Bcz Asia sizing is different than America sizing,) then you will be looking swag fr. Shipping is always better than expected, at least so far. Usually around 2 weeks which more expensive places can take anyways.

750,Love the easy shopping on AliExpress!,False,4,"I’m enjoying the great deals on AliExpress. It’s easy shopping using their app. 

So far, I’m happy with almost every order except an order that I placed on 6 April 2019 and 4 June 2019. The order in April was shipped to the wrong address on the other side of the USA (2,000+ kilometers), but thankfully I was refunded by AliExpress when I submitted a disputed. The other order I made in June was clearly the wrong charging cable for an iPhone X. I have yet to open a disputed but I plan to do so within the next day. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with the wrong charging cable. I have no idea what it fits.",2019-07-05 05:23:15,Hapa Haole Wahine
751,I’ve rated before,False,1,"I’ve rated this app before have it 5 stars, I’ve been using it for years and I’ve seen how much they expanded, I still love it but I HATE how I can only use this app with home wifi, but not your phones WiFi. My house WiFi is pretty slow compared to my phones, I’m on this app all the time but ever since a update a few months ago I could only use this app in places that have WiFi, not just on my phone whenever I want, I put up with it at first, thought it was a temporary bug and they would fix it next update, but it’s been months. I don’t know if it’s just my phone but it does the same thing with my sisters phone so I don’t think it’s just mine? I’m just trying to shop and give you my money, why won’t you work properly 😭",2018-10-27 06:48:56,Itworksssss
752,Don’t use wish!,False,5,"AliExpress is fast to refund and generally takes the buyers side, while I’ve only had to request a refund once, I’ve always had a super stellar experience. Yeah, shopping might be a bit slow, but it is coming from overseas, products are extremely affordable on a budget. And by the time products arrive, I’ve almost forgotten I’ve ordered them, almost. It’s like opening a present, and quality is very great for the price and wait.",2022-08-31 16:24:08,DovesDmg

My daughter get ask all the time where she get her clothes….I will only tell some but most of the time I keep you to myself.
I have loved every single thing I purchased for my family 
Thank you",2022-05-26 14:01:17,grandmom lilly
754,I LOVE AliExpress SO MUCH!!!,False,5,"I order from AliExpress almost every single day, lol! 

The PROS: I’m always finding amazing deals on things like Bluetooth headphones (under $12), real 925 sterling silver jewelry ($5 or less), quality eyeshadow palettes (under $10), lingerie (under $10), women’s sandals ($10 or under), art supplies ($5 or under), pet supplies (under $10) & so much more! As long as you read the descriptions thoroughly, you can find some real quality items for cheap! They have a lot of fun games that you can play daily to earn amazing coupons & discounts! If you can dream it up, it’s likely you’ll find it at this store. Items for the entire family! 

The CONS: The shipping times can be long-sometimes up to 5-6wks. BUT, as long as you’re not in a major hurry, it’s worth the wait!! 

HIGHLY recommend everyone checking it out!!",2022-03-19 17:49:20,thewellnessmama
755,Good App but read reviews carefully when purchasing,False,3,"AliExpress, like any other apps has its perks but it is a good source for shopping on the budget. You can buy certain items in bulk for a very low price, the only problem is the time stamp. (Maybe some shipping issues depending on the seller) You buy a product and will most likely have to wait MONTHS for it to receive, but if you know how to shop and also have some luck the stores shipping may take up to a month or less. Just be on the lookout when shopping on this app and also for the sellers response!",2022-03-26 23:16:20,Goodgirl😊😊
756,Convenient for all customer types!,False,5,Hi Shop we’re all types of products for my companies and seems that this company happens to be the one I always resort to to always find whatever product it is I may need and always shows up in a timely manner and she was tracking along the way to give comfort of whatever the product is that’s being shipped.I have already recommended this site to multiple other business owners as well.,2022-02-05 20:00:58,AnM CustomZ
757,Have really enjoyed everything about the app so far,False,5,"I wish we could create more folders for our wish list section though.  You can only create 10 folders to separate your items to save in a wish list for future purchases. 
A way to search by word in the wish list would even be helpful. 
If you have hundreds of items saved and broken into 10 categories in the wish list it is sometimes hard to find when you want put together a purchase. 
Anyway - overall great app and prices!
My only suggestion is improvements to the wishlist section. 
And yes, you do have to wait sometimes 4 -8 weeks to get your items. They are literally being shipped on slow boat from China. That’s why the shipping is so inexpensive or even free. So people shouldn’t complain about that.",2022-01-20 06:15:26,JRL_IPhone4
758,Shipping and Quality,False,4,"The app is awesome, I get to find so many things that I want to get at once. But my only problem is that it takes too long to ship, and you always have to be careful with the product you buy and make sure you read the reviews and description carefully otherwise you could end up with something completely different. I haven’t faced that issue except for once, but it was still dissatisfying. Hopefully though I won’t have to go through it again.",2022-01-22 16:05:30,Damndouma

760,Great App,False,5,I feel like ali express is a great app !! I would just say if you want something from off there to order it Atleast a month ahead because sometimes shipping can take a little while . I would make sure to look at the reviews before purchasing from vendors on there because some of them do steal the pictures from others reviews . Other than that ali express is affordable & everything I’ve ordered from there was good quality .,2021-10-30 12:01:28,Keke Oshae

762,Two and a half Months to never receive two orders!!,False,1,"This site makes its own rules regarding delivery times!!  I placed a multiple item order and everything came within a month except for two.  I waited two and a half months after filing a dispute, which kept getting decisions like “give shipping more time!!”  After I had placed my order on April 2nd and it was already June. 16th!!  I never as of yet received those two items and I was actually messaged by one of the time offenders was, “If you receive the item, please let us know so you can pay us.”  Just what I am NOT going to do.

I love it I can’t wait to set it up for 2021.🥰😘Also I got the FedEx shipping and it never updated but it arrived in less than a week and it was even more exciting because I didn’t know it was coming. So if you get the FedEx shipping and it doesn’t update don’t worry it’s still on its way.,2020-12-18 18:33:12,mysticplanner
764,AliExpress opens commerce for ordinary people who use Chinese products.,False,5,"This marketplace is just another version of the US online stores, only the products are directly from China, and their sales are directed towards the interests of foreigners. I find this market to offer options not usually available in the states, and some products are offered for sale at substantial savings, even when shipping charges are tacked onto the final price. So far I have only had positive experiences from using this shopping alternative.",2020-08-19 21:37:31,Need-to-know
765,Worst Delivery App,False,1,"The packages take too long and the sellers are hard to communicate with. The disputes make no sense and it’s hard to get in contact with Ali Express. It took three months for one of my packages to come in and most of the sellers don’t even speak English. The disputes don’t really help you, they just make you wait longer instead of just getting the refund and most of the time, the sellers won’t give it to you. The only way that you can contact Ali Express is by opening up a dispute because you can’t actually email or call them. I’m still currently waiting for a package that I ordered in September and it’s now December. I highly recommend using some other delivery app instead of this trash.",2020-12-03 15:03:10,Zombies2003
766,Fave New App,False,5,I recently found out about this app...a year ago after I was very disappointed about an order I never received from Wish. I was very upset but after searching around for a different app I came across Aliexpress. I seen all what they offered & ordered quite a few things including six phone cases & DIY 3D stickers 😆. I received all my purchases & even a few free gifts but overall o received my items in no more than three weeks. I’m very happy to found this app & will continue to be a proud supporter 🤩👍🏾!,2020-03-28 21:50:47,DesiDee4523

But that is not the case with AliExpress!! ❤️ I have ordered phone/AirPod cases, nail supplies and accessories, skin oils, scrunchies, turbans, jewelry, and headband elastics! Nothing has come damaged or not up to my expectations. ✨Then again you get what you pay for so the things you order are not going to be extreme high quality by the will not be bad quality at all. Shipping usually takes around 3-6 weeks for me though 🤷🏻‍♀️",2019-08-27 01:11:48,gaby10martinez
768,Love this store!,False,5,"It may take a little while to get my orders but it is so worth it. I can get great unique stuff for a great price. The customer service is top notch and always a great help. Also, I do most of my kids school clothes shopping at aliexpress because of the quality and the fact that they aren't wearing what everybody else is. If you can be patient because it does take up to a month sometimes to get some of the stuff, it is totally worth the wait.",2022-11-11 04:49:17,Love and hate!!!
769,"Be wise, and you’ll save plenty.",False,4,"Never trust the seller’s image; look for products that have customer review photos. Yes, most products are imitation goods that use the official product’s image to sell. Be aware of what you are buying, and be wary. If the price is too good to be true, it is likely the knockoff variety, so only buy if you are okay with that.  However, aliexpress is a great place for cheaply buying craft supplies and fashion accessories. Expect a long shipping wait when getting free shipping. Don’t raise your expectations too high when you are paying much less, and you will be pleasantly surprised.",2019-04-05 03:31:08,Preeeyaro
770,Buyers Assurance,False,3,I have been ordering from Ali express for over a year now and have always been happy with how quickly items arrived and with the speed of refunds if something was wrong. Until now. I ordered lots of items for the holidays. Two of the orders didn’t ever come. This is a first for me so I went in to ask for the refund per Buyers Assurance. I didn’t know you had to actually dicker with the vendor to get the refund. One of the Vendors doesn’t want to refund $1.24. Ali Express won’t do anything until you complete a 3 day process. But then will give the refund. So beware if you don’t get your items. You have to go through a process.,2019-01-16 15:31:26,Coleena the Paldena

You have to read reviews and look at reviews that have photos because that helps to see the quality of your product! Make sure to look at how many orders it’s had! Hands down great app! The best thing is that AliExpress holds on to your money then gives it to the seller once you confirm the good you have purchased. The app is also super fast!",2021-07-27 20:09:48,ArielTaylorAnn

Or 30% the items are broken, very poor stitching. Got to do their work myself. Otherwise as war & pandemic going on, half of the items now with shipping is even more expensive than to just go to a store locally. ( socks for instance) crazy prices, some poorly done job.

I have put in a dispute like you are supposed to do, and I went to my post office, but the packages aren’t there and they refuse to refund me. So I am alerting anyone I can to let them know they may get swindled like I did. 😡

775,One of my favorite online stores!,False,5,I downloaded this app because a lot of people just resell items from Aliexpress for 3x the price on other websites so I got this app to buy directly from the source at a much cheaper price. I’ve been using this app for over 2 years and I’ve loved all the purchases i’ve made :) The sellers are usually always nice and responsive.

776,"Well made app, unfortunately inconsistent tracking",False,4,"My only real complaint about this company is how difficult it is to predict the arrival of purchases. Some things show up at the door without ever saying they shipped, and some say they shipped and then never give updates on where they are, and others simply take forever to be sent out. They are generally pretty quick though, nothing has so far showed up damaged in my 8 purchases from them, and they have a truly colossal assortment of things to buy",2021-01-07 15:47:11,This is farta
777,"Prices & choices excellent, website...not so perfect.",False,4,"Prices & choices excellent, website...not so perfect. The reason for my FRUSTRATION is the fact that when I leave a window to complete an interfering task, the system DOES NOT BRING ME BACK at the place where I was before. 
Example: I’m searching my orders to see which ones I have to confirm as received. I find one and confirm it. I want to CONTINUE to search for the other needed confirmations and the system BRINGS ME AT THE START of my orders INSTEAD OF BRINGING ME WHERE I LEFT MY ORDER LIST!

If there’s going to be a delay with my order because of a holiday IT NEEDS TO SAY THAT BEFORE I ORDER SOMETHING. It’s wrong and misleading, especially if you’re spending over $150+ and expecting something on the date it says you’d receive it by if you order it said date... Even if I order before, during or after a holiday I shouldn’t have to wait longer to receive my items. I won’t be buying too much after this experience though because I’m sure I won’t be receiving my order and will have to file a dispute.",2020-02-13 02:46:36,JQ:12/19

I do however hate this new messaging system to contact the sellers. It gets confusing and aggravating because it will show it sent on the AliExpress messages but the seller either never gets them or they go unread. I wish they would go back to the old way instead of having to use Facebook messenger and search for who you want to chat with that way!

At times they track and claim items have arrived; and maybe they do but they stop tracking at the post office.. believe that some items delivered to the wrong address because some items never arrived.. you need more standardization in sizes and more accurate tracking and faster delivery.. without overly charging unless you specify why..,2022-06-30 03:06:54,T-Bone Miami Beach

I have been waiting for four months don’t waste your time you can find the same things anywhere else you might think you’re getting a good price but you’re not cause at the end they charge you taxes and shipping is even more expensive now and to not even receive it. I have 30 orders waiting to be sent they have been playing it off giving me shipping information that is not accurate and once it hits the date they are supposed to arrive the website allows them more time, about 30days then they change the shipping information again",2020-05-30 18:11:36,Nancy212121
800,Great app if you don’t mind waiting,False,5,Love it! Everything is super cheap and they have pretty much everything I need. The shipping takes a long time but I don’t really mind at all. It makes it kind of exciting because I never really know when my package is gonna show up haha. They also love giving you coupons and discounts and stuff which is awesome when the products are already so cheap. The phone case I have right now I got for only a dollar! It’s a fluffy cat and I get a lot of compliments on it at work.,2020-05-09 00:37:19,BunnyGirl613
801,I Love This App,False,5,I love how it’s has pictures of the item that that people bought and you can also take A picture and it will scan what your looking for and its shows the ratings of the product and reviews and you can also help people out bye replying back to there review and telling them like if they bought the same product and know how to use it the can tell you and when they do it will ask you if it’s helpful or not,2020-05-06 18:57:08,sims love 😍it

The app is very easy to use. You can find most anything you are looking for here, from clothes, items for your pet, your car. The possibilities are endless on this site. If you don’t need what you are looking for within a week and can wait a little bit, I highly recommend shopping here. The prices are fantastic!",2020-01-01 05:05:13,JcR47-1
803,Like other apps,False,4,"This apps did hooked me in for $19 coupons once opened a new account. They split coupons into $2, $5, etc.. which I expect to have 1 full coupon of $19. I bought many items on AliExpress. The seller sent shortage of items. Got refund, but lose the coupon amount. It is hard to figure out on how to contact AliExpress to make the disputes. Would be nice if there is live Customerservice. I don’t really dare to shop a lot on this apps. I feel like AliExpress has many sellers that are cheated on purpose. Hope I’m wrong, but that’s just my feeling. Good Luck to everyone!",2020-01-18 02:44:40,Jmfbfiw
804,Started shopping online because of them!!!!,False,5,"This app is really great for getting things out of the country instead of paying that 5$ for something you could get cheaper here. Of course there are some set backs on what you should buy in the app. I don’t buy shoes here only but I’ve bought clothes, makeup items, wash scrubs, many accessories, and the only complaint I have is that it may take too long for things to arrive but it his worth it. Get more than you ask for, for under 10$!!!",2019-12-10 03:51:30,fuibfdsolbfew
805,Nice app but buggy,False,5,"Overall the app is good, works fine and is good organized, but just a few days ago I could not see my cart. It says that it is empty but I had several item in it, some for a long time and some recent. Its annoying because I searched for a long time to find some items and put it in the cart, but now I can not see/buy those. I hope this problem will be solved soon so I could continue my shopping.

807,Best shopping app,False,5,"I love this app! I’ve bought hundreds of things for my business and house and I’ve only had one thing get lost in the mail which they immediately refunded me when they found out. It’s very inexpensive and some things are sold in bundles which makes it even cheaper. The best thing is the reviews that have many pictures, videos and explanations of the products your buying so that way you always know for sure what your getting so there’s no guessing if it’s worth buying.",2018-11-09 19:21:53,lilysrainbow

If you have a problem with a product because it is defective, doesn’t function well or is of poor quality they will deny full refund but maybe only give you a small portion of what you paid or deny any refund. Forget the warranty or sending it back, that’s a scam because it costs more then the item in shipping costs. So make sure to check out items carefully before you order and if it actually arrives you will be happy.",2019-05-18 14:35:37,Fiyrman
809,Bad sellers and god sellers,False,3,"Ok I will start with this, I love this app the 3 starts are for the great sellers who send your items and you get those items in 10 to 11 days so fast let’s be honest China is not in the corner ok, o right so what I don’t like from this app is AliExpress give the seller the option to confirm item has shipped out when that’s not true, so what I will recommend to AliExpress is to update your app and give an option to sellers of 3 days for shipped out the items and ask them for a tracking # confirmation that way you guys make sure they send the items... that will be cool. Please do it because that will help the your app grows 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰",2019-01-31 13:18:06,Cruz de Bonilla

Kindly read there rules and sellers rules too before buying and if you have any issues with any product you bought or any seller try talk to a rep and ask how you can present your case.

This is the place to get them. Granted, it takes a bit longer to get what I order, but it is well worth the wait. The quality and value of what I have found cannot be matched.   I HIGHLY recommend this app. Just a warning note.  Be ready to spend HOURS browsing through it. At 1 A.M. I realized it was time to shut it down! Lol. 😴",2018-03-26 13:06:01,NanaPatty
812,Mall/Market is GREAT!,False,5,If perhaps their is a way to connect with developer regarding a wholesale mission/fulfillment of surplus this could impact my local environment & provide a greater range of diversity in such Mall Markets. We have a vacancy (empty mall) up the street that could be reinstated/reinvested into/upon. Really introduce a new value to the local economy besides that of the Outlets growth that are nearby as well our regular mall and it’s expansion. Would be a delightful pleasure to hold interests within the idea of connecting with someone whom could aid in developing.,2022-11-13 01:09:54,0008888
813,Great site to buy good merchandise but with some limitations!,False,4,"I am based at the United States and have been shopping on AliExpress for 3 years now. With the exception of two orders where I never received the packages but had to work it out with AliExpress, the experience had been great. The headache comes when I filed a dispute, AliExpress always denied my request and asking me to provide evidence that I DID NOT receive the package, but they never provided evidence that the packages were delivered to my address. This is the reason I give this site 4 out of 5 stars.",2022-11-27 00:37:00,Heelpppp

815,"Easy to locate stores, support",False,5,"The program has improved its ability to locate vendors and items, stores that you previously ordered item from, they back up the customer and resolve issues that arrive. They need to eliminate vendors with deceptive practices. I’ve been using this website for over a year and they are much much better. The customer should receive more support when the vendor is sending inferior products",2022-07-28 05:25:00,Gloria Pinney
816,I don’t mind the wait,False,5,"Honestly, when I see something on one of the other seller sites, oftentimes I will go to AliExpress to see if I can get it at a lower price with free or discounted shipping. Seriously, AliExpress has EVERYTHING. Sometimes shipping can take anywhere from 10-30 days but that’s part of what pawn makes shopping on Ali fun - BAM something shows up in the mailbox that you forgot you ordered or WHEEEE your thing showed up earlier than you expected and oooo what a deal!!!!",2022-06-15 18:14:52,Juliamonster
817,Love it!,False,5,"I have bought many clothing items and shoes from this app and have not had any issues. Everything I have ordered has been exactly what I expected. However, you must read the store’s reviews in order to know what you’re buying. The one thing I wish would be better, is the shipping time but we all know where these items are coming from so I guess we have to be patient. Gotta go! Must continue my shopping…",2022-02-21 01:28:04,Hanylicious
818,worth every cent,False,5,I received a 30’ full lace 250% density body wave wig. The seller’s communication was phenomenal. The shipping was faster than I expected. This wig is very true to length but I do feel like this is more of a 200% density wig not really a 250% density wig . The knots on this wig were very easy to bleach. The quality of the lace overall was very good. I definitely recommend purchasing this wig because you get a very accurate description of what you are paying for and the price was very reasonable.,2022-02-20 21:04:58,Britney Essel
819,Don’t use AliExpress,False,1,"Usually things that seem too good to be true are this was no exception to that rule. I have NEVER received a AliExpress package once. The most recent reason is it got sent to the wrong address far away from my real Address. Another is that it got returned to the sender. The dispute process is the worst thing I’ve ever had to go through. It says “100% back guaranteed” and that is simply not true. While in the dispute process AliExpress gives me excuse after excuse and simply don’t want to give you your money back. It took me multiple weeks of anger and explaining how they made a mistake and had to pay for it, and no I still have not received my money back. Do yourself a favor and DON’T TRUST ALIEXPRESS.",2021-09-21 04:25:53,SaltySharko
820,Love this App,False,5,"Best App EVER!!! I truly enjoy AliExpress and what I love the most is I have never had an issue with my order. If I order 50 I get 50. Unlike other sites that try to skimp you short 1 or 2, AliExpress is honest and legit. I’m definitely happy with this online store and I will continue to do business with them. My small business is growing thanks to the small items I buy for my shop. Definitely worth the down load. Site runs smoothly and no glitches. TRY IT !!!!",2021-08-26 13:33:11,Maryann N Manda
821,Honest review,False,1,So I like the idea of AliExpress and get stuf for cheaper price that’s why I tried it out but there’s scammers and a lot of them and AliExpress don’t have any way to help if fact you have to argue to prove that your getting scammed and I did and still I supposedly didn’t get my monkey back the guy sold me 2 items for like 100$ and closed his shop and took of his items and it says it’s on it way since the day I bought it like 2 to 3 months ago if your going to use this app it’s not trust worthy and that’s what matters to me definitely when you credit card Is put on this app . And I never got my money back or had anything shipped to my house if anyone could help me that would be great,2021-09-18 15:50:16,ky9264
822,It’s great but just takes a little bit of time for arrival!,False,5,This is amazing when you just want to have something that is even unavailable in my country and also anything you’d need but very inexpensive! The only catch is it will take a few months for anything to arrive even when coming from the same country which is fine.. overall wonderful and very addictive but in a affordable and easy way! Never going back to average commercial prices in my country,2020-11-27 11:41:16,Minironin
823,"Fun, but needs improvement",False,1,"Enjoyed shopping until I needed help with an order gone wrong. The customer service was abysmal, my only option of getting in touch was the automated EVA bot. Couldn’t even submit a query pertaining to my issue (was sent another person’s package not even purchased from AliExpress), couldn’t submit photo evidence of wrong items and never received the item I paid for. I requested to talk to a live agent multiple times and never was contacted once. Instead, I was sent surveys about my experience, and still haven’t had the issue resolved. I have a final order I’m waiting on to be delivered, and I’m stressing out that if anything is wrong with it I will be screwed over.",2021-05-02 11:20:24,Sidney & Liam's Dad
824,A lot of the features don’t work on the app,False,3,I really enjoy ordering from this site the only downfall is a lot of the features on the app do not work you win coupons but you don’t receive them so I don’t understand what that’s all about and sometimes I find items on the website to be cheaper than the app and it’s supposed to be the exact opposite so there is definitely some bugs that need to be fixed in this app otherwise I like the products that they sell if you have time to wait on them shipping can sometimes be very slow,2021-01-25 20:10:16,Staceyaug25

Also my other order arrived in such good and safe packaging 😍 The shipping was pretty fast too that I didn't expect at all. I absolutely would give more than 5 stars 🌟 The only thing is that you should be careful with the sellers. Great great great.",2020-11-18 05:38:38,_.__hani

The shipping took three months tho and I wasn’t very pleased about that and let the seller know. Seller was in communication with me to just be patient . Today I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my mail box . Would I order again? YES but with no expectation when it will arrive . Maybe with Covid , shipping was just off. The tracking gave me confusing info that it arrived when it never did . So def stay on top of shipping .",2020-07-28 21:28:03,FaceMaskUSA
827,Super Sketchy,False,1,"I was looking for a new phone case and read a bunch of reviews before I purchased, I saw a lot of bad reviews but decided to get one anyways since the reviews were mixed and it was so cheap. They had an option for PayPal but wouldn’t let me sign in to it so I HAD to put in my card info which was a little sketchy. And then when I put through the order, it immediately tells me that “something went wrong” and to try again later. But later on I realized they charged my card anyways!! They had absolutely NO customer that you could contact and the seller was incredibly rude when I complained about it. I had to have my bank file a dispute. I knew I should’ve trusted my gut. Most of the sellers on there are scammers.",2020-11-17 01:52:58,chl03m

If you’re looking for it, it’s very likely you’ll find it here. The service is great and friendly, and the shipping is one of the fastest I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Even if you have a bad experience with a store, your money can and will be returned to you. You could even find another store altogether that will be more than happy to fulfill your order!

I have recently ordered stuff and I was afraid I was going to get covid-19 but I didn’t so that’s good. Out of the 40-50 products I bought from here, I’ve only had problems with 4 things and that was because the overdue shipping or no response at all, but I got a refund. Overall, I recommend this app if you’re looking for cheap products.",2020-03-13 22:58:50,Xxxrfsdt

Not disappointed what so ever. Highly recommend. I’m not saying you’ll never get disappointed but from my experience and what i’ve ordered. it’s been great, just have to wait a long time for it so don’t rely on it to be here by a certain day but it’ll get to you. awesome app!",2020-03-10 06:17:49,mooriyuh
831,I love this AliExpress,False,5,"When I first got the app and signed up they had and offer for $3 off my first order and I was really pleased with my first purchase. It’s not like wish were everything is “cheap” to buy then BOOM! Then shipping is about the same amount as your order price. Most of their items are free shipping and pretty cheap but the product are not.

833,Literal best website ever,False,5,"AliExpress is better than Wish and Banggood and all that, they have great prices and usually free shipping. Love their stationary so kawaii and affordable.

I suggest playing it safe when buying clothes and such by checking the reviews but most of the time great experience when buying other stuff.

834,Better than Wish,False,4,"I’ve had more success on AliExpress than I have on Wish, in terms of getting quality items shipped from China. Definitely read the descriptions of what you’re buying and I tend to avoid clothing/shoes. Shipping is slow, sometimes I receive my order in the mail forgetting I placed it.. although I’ve received items faster than the date listed on the Order Tracking page. So far I’ve contacted one vendor (from US) about a miss sized item, they displayed excellent customer service and fixed the mistake promptly/professionally.",2019-11-21 02:38:32,RMC00P

I have made some decent purchases in the past though. I do miss when they use to sell food on here, loved the mochi, can’t find the ones I cared for on any site now. Other than, this site is a roll with dice when you’re looking for something worth while. It doesn’t hurt to try if you are smart about it! I will say also, 
much better than (wish)😉",2019-07-30 07:34:21,SleepyWolf25
836,Seriously Amazing App,False,5,"One of my very favorite things about this app, (and there are a few) is the fact that you can upload a photo of the item you’re looking for, this feature alone has saved me so much money and time!! The quality of the products I’ve ordered has been great as well and the shipping has been far faster than I originally thought, which was a pleasant surprise-in short, you will love this app, it will be your go to for everything from clothing to kitchen. ❤️",2019-03-06 17:49:17,QueenMeRee

Make sure you read the comments and the specs. 3. If a deal is too good to be true prob is. 4. AliExpress shopping is addictive. 5. AliExpress is amazing as resolving dispute. They do happen way to frequent so get used to it.

Lately more sellers put up lower prices and/ free shipping to lure you in just to raise the price and charge shipping once you select a product. Super annoying and honestly makes me shop way less on here then previously.

The same products that you see advertised on social media sights at a cheap discounted price, can be found at AliExpress even cheaper.

842,Quality of products,False,5,I have purchased several items from this App and thus far the quality has been great!  I’m not happy about the long wait times but is no surprise since they give you an estimate time at purchase.  Some vendors are faster than others.  I keep note of those and order more with them.

 I have found I rarely actually ever receive a refund?? And if you do it takes so long you you good luck figuring out what order it was for. 
Plus to the best of my understanding there is NO way to follow up if you don’t receive your refund???

I’m not saying I expect same day shipping but 2 months, seriously? 

I don’t normally write reviews but I think if a customer is having trouble with this app there should at least be a number to call to help someone or something, not just some 2 step pictures to help you “find” your tracking number or something.",2020-11-17 19:17:34,XxBabyUnicornxX
849,Love the app but....,False,4,"I love aliexpress so much better than  the wish app. The one thing I don’t like and I feel they need to monitor more is how some people will leave a review or feedback on items they bought and they will put up photos along with it that are disrespectful and absolutely disgusting to put on a shopping app. IV seen woman add photos with there reviews/feedback on a lingerie they bought and they are showing areas you just don’t show to the world or definitely no shopping app anyway. Other than the horrible photos I see at times, I love the app.",2020-09-15 06:29:26,nekls enkdkdnns848
850,Pleasantly surprised,False,5,"I am really shocked yet pleased with my experience so far.  I figured shipping times would be long.  So, I purchased winter items in the spring/summer to assure they would come in time.  The longest I’ve had to wait was about a month.  All items have been INCREDIBLE!  Very high quality, and very well made!  I do however read all shop reviews and look at pictures so I can get a better idea of their products.  I highly recommend!  Just be mindful of the shipping times and shipping rates!",2020-07-10 16:03:25,Kay924
851,So much better than wish,False,5,"I used to buying everything from wish. Then I discovered AliExpress and I never went back. I feel that this app is so much easier to use. The items are cheaper and better quality. The only down side is that things take awhile to arrive, but it was like that when ordering from wish. I have my own business where I make crafts and this app has been so helpful. I definitely recommend my crafty people out there to buy from here.",2020-03-22 17:41:34,ac7m17
852,Luigi designer,False,2,"Its sad to see how a large company doesn't have telephone customer service numbers, it's to slow with it's computer system, which is hard to reach a live chat, it's clearly behind it's customer service. And about all, if you have refund problems, they are to slow to keep control of what's going on. Its a week and UPSP delivery to their wherehouse was done and still can't imput receiving the package, so slow and irresponsible. They fast to charge you for products but forget giving back. Slow as can be.  The communication between Aliexpress and stores is faulty.  Wish company has better ways compare to this.  I don't recommend this company to no one.",2020-07-04 13:06:51,Luigi Designer
853,Should’ve kept the old version.,False,3,"I use to love Ali express, however not particularly thrilled with this new version. It’s a lot harder to navigate I’ve found and not as intuitive. Wish I could unload it and go back to the old version. Nonetheless I Ali express though. 95% of the sellers are honest, honorable and try and do right by you. But when they don’t Ali Express is worthless as an intermediary. If have not arrived within protection period ask vendor to increase protection time. If they don’t fo do file for refund at once or you will lose any recourse. Don’t spend more than you’re willing to lose if there is ever an issue.",2020-06-15 03:08:06,catboxstinx
854,Disappearance of old orders,False,4,"Though I can log in via laptop and access my orders online, for some reasons (after they updated the previous version), I can no longer see what I had bought in the past (on apps). I can only see this year (2020) until now, but not from 2019 and before. Some items I’d love to repurchase, I cannot do it since the old orders were gone. Besides that, I love buying from AliExpress because it’s cheap; the apps also has English components and friendly users. All shops communicate in English so that’s good. Highly recommended apps!",2020-02-20 04:21:32,kaOxtaR
855,So much here!,False,4,"A bit hard to find things which can lead to serendipitous discoveries, but also sometimes overspending. It’s kind of dangerous, really. Also, the way some sellers have multiple items listed can make it easy to order the Wong thing. For example, I was sure I had ordered Rose gold & wound up receiving just plain gold. It’s nice enough & not worth the trouble of returning. Just be careful & double check all details when you order

I’d like to be able to see larger images of what I’ve purchased more easily to recall what I’m still waiting for.",2020-01-05 18:07:55,vgcurrie

As long as I have my money to pay for my order, I think payment shouldn’t be the issue stopping me from buying it, have  been declined severely by this app from buying things once my total payment is more than $20 which is not fair. Pls try and do something about it and if am the only one experiencing this pls admin of this app should try and help me do something about it. I want to buy a lot of things but that issue is stopping.",2022-11-03 12:21:10,ronnie496
857,Worst app,False,1,"Honestly the prices are really good and all but when you order your items and the order is placed , processed and shipped etc. , when you go to track your order it doesn’t update when it leaves the country , I have literally NO IDEA where my items are I ordered them in September and it is now October . I don’t even know if my items have even came ! The tracking is still saying the same thing from two weeks ago! The package just randomly shows up and you don’t even know . Once my items come or whenever they come . I will NEVER order from here again it it’s ridiculous
Update : it is currently November and I still have received an item I ordered in September I’m never recommending this app to anyone",2019-11-14 16:55:10,Night wishes
858,Love AliExpress- Disappointed in Dispute Process,False,2,"Have purchased 15 to 20 items through AliExpress.  Recently purchased a really nice swimsuit that never arrived.  Checked with the carrier, but ultimately had no recourse.  Can’t prove a negative.  Likely delivered to the wrong address.  AliExpress offered me a refund after several days of dispute, which I accepted.  A day later they wrote me and said they were denying the refund (What ???). Just received a great item today from AliExpress and have two more coming.  After that I’ll likely need to close down my account.  Very disappointed.  Really expected more from this company.  They won’t stand by you!",2022-11-16 01:46:08,HappyTimesAreHereAgan
859,Terrible experience,False,1,"Item was not shipped correctly and canceled by Chinese customs/post. Seller looked into it, and once it became clear the issue would be a refund while the product returned to them would only respond in simplified Chinese instead of the english they were previously very proficient in, which I needed to have translated to continue the dispute. Neither the seller or later AliExpress’s CS center (I never received any response from tickets to AliExpress whatsoever) issued any refund. In the end, I had to go through Paypal and wait another 3 weeks (almost 2 months at this point) while they investigated before I got my money returned. Save yourself the hassle, I wish I had avoided this app.",2022-10-11 01:47:37,Torias327

863,Long time customer and best app for prices,False,5,I been using AliExpress for almost a decade and I have very few times been dissatisfied with an item. The quality is always as described and I especially love it when people leave photo reviews because it gives the customer more assurance in buying the product. They are constantly improving the app and they make it more interactive and engaging to find the products you like.,2021-11-13 22:30:07,ajbarron
864,Great company,False,5,"If your gonna order internationally it’s nice to have a place like this that keeps track of your stuff and makes sure you get it. Sure it can take a while sometimes but I’d rather that than the other option which feels like surfing random sites in other languages then throwing your money into the void… not knowing if you’ll ever her back. 
You can follow your orders progress and even get points to use for coupons",2021-06-27 19:48:25,blKliZrd

I check all of my orders and follow all of them communication with each seller is easier and I really appreciate the brief and small alerts of sales especially from my favorite stores!! It’s been awesome...I think of something can find on a dime especially with the picture recognizing app!! Love it even more! And most of shopping and shipping has been right on. Only a couple of glitches but not too much loss of money,2021-01-23 06:52:56,Ebert j's4 gang
866,Quite dissatisfied ngl,False,3,"I was recommended this app for my style, since you can’t find clothes for my style anywhere else. When I got the app,I was really excited. But items that had nothing to do with the stuff I was looking at was popping up on my feed, and when I tried to tap the “I don’t like this item” button it would take me too the item! I was just trying to find t-shirts and skirts,I didn’t need this stuff that was completely unrelated to what I was looking for on my feed. It’s pretty annoying. I thought this app was better,I’m very disappointed.",2021-02-04 21:24:38,$CRYBXBY$
867,If you ain’t shopping on Ali express what are u doing with your life,False,5,Great app I’ve used it for years. Even before it became so popular I was telling women at my former place of employment about the site. Back then they had hair like dirt cheap. Nice hair. Then everyone started finding out about it and now it isn’t so cheap. But they still have many of other things that I love buying for a cheaper price then I would find anywhere else. The only downside is waiting like a month for the delivery. But it’s worth it,2020-11-24 01:28:03,wueb dbcndjeieibdhcux
868,Dumb errors when comes to paying,False,3,"I keep getting various error codes, specifically when it comes to purchasing. I’ve had no disputes, done no chargebacks, or anything dishonest on this app. I bought multiple things from this app successfully, but suddenly I get an error saying I have to make an appeal, due to security reasons with the card I’m trying to pay with. I am uncomfortable giving AliExpress my information, therefore I have no idea what to do. Customer support is terrible, my card has done nothing fraudulent, therefore I’m stuck in a pathetic loop of errors.",2020-12-06 20:31:48,cacasapp

Not to mention the freebies tab and the great customer service when it comes to disputes. I never received an item and the people of AliExpress were able to give me a refund. You can also make list that can easier go into your cart which is so convenient. I honestly love this app and I’m happy my friend recommended it to me.",2020-04-07 06:42:51,Awesomeladdy
870,Sh** some of them are scammers,False,1,"Would have give negative star if I could for the terrible customer service. 

I placed many order on there over the years and sometimes have problem with some of them but since the delivery is around 1-3 months I sometime just forget about the item. But recently, April 15th of 2020 I placed an order for some belts. 3 belts from the same company to be exact and they never show up. Tracking is obviously fake cause they barely never had clear information in the delivery updates. Can’t be track while it was in delivery but only showed up as delivered while the package never came. So I did what a normal person would do, put in a dispute and wait. And the “case manager” dismiss the dispute and rule that there’s nothing they can do to give me a refund. I can’t appeal the result either and can’t contact a single REAL human being for the problem I had. Just UTTERLY stupid ruling and judgement from a computer. 

BTW: the SELLER store is called Little Fortunate Store. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. 
With that type of name I should’ve known.",2020-04-23 21:42:35,chauchac
871,AliExpress and packages from afar,False,5,"I really enjoy Ali express because it is an inexpensive experiment in foreign commerce. Having said that shopping on AliExpress is like a box of chocolates you never really know what you're going to get. You can't tell by images about the quality the name brands are not the ones we recognize in America, and Siri language barrier is sometimes difficult. 

Like any place that you shop some stores are better than others but this app brings Americans close to vendors worldwide and I like it.",2019-05-20 20:57:42,Loves_Blues

873,Love the customer service.,False,5,"Website is easy to navigate. Communication with sellers its easy. 

Sometimes quality of items ordered are not the best quality or correct size/color as specified, but often enough customer service will do everything possible to fix the order. Often with photos of the issue you are given a refund. Since shipping back returned items to China is often more costly then the item itself, they will let you keep it.",2019-03-28 20:01:04,Souce of Deployed Soldier
874,Amazing place to shop if you know what your doing,False,5,"For the most part like any shopping site like this, shipping is gonna take forever so take that into account. BUT so long as you read descriptions and reviews you should never have problems. 
You can also open disputes if you didn’t get the right the g, ext. So scamming isn’t an issue really. Just make sure you read everything and not just buy. As a Crafter and artist, this is the place to get stuff!! You won’t be disappointed",2019-01-08 04:01:28,Theroseowl
875,Amazing shopping experience,False,5,"I found the app to be very easy to use and very helpful, but I find the discount system not so nice. Maybe because I use to buy only small amount of items. But if we buy large amount of items it maybe ok. Otherwise the application is very nice. Overall it’s a very fast and helpful. I can find almost anything at AliExpress. Really recommend this for those who want those rare items.",2022-08-31 08:49:33,moosa rameez
876,Bots and Prices,False,2,"they have some cheap prices but you really do get what you pay for. sometimes you don’t even get that and they just send you something else. or it’s just outright false advertising and you don’t get anything but poor management skills from agents. bots do most of maintenance of the site so if a bot wrongly flaggs your account and you can’t buy anything, 🤷🏾‍♀️ oh well the actual staff/real employees can’t undo the actions all they can do is offer you a coupon for 10% off when you buy $100+ worth of things. please make it so you can at least undo the actions of a bot or offer more to compensate.",2022-09-14 22:57:50,MyanBrow

But, so be it, most items arrive in a reasonable time. Price on most items very good. Other items maybe cheaper somewhere else. Look at what you want very close reference size and what your actually getting. Just like eBay, some use micro photography. Great place to save if your not in a hurry.

On top of that when i ask for full refund. Aliexpress only return 20% of its original value.

I’ve also tried following the thank you card and it’s never where I follow it to. They pretty much jumble everything around in the end.",2021-07-25 23:52:00,hspahsosksk

Waiting for them can be a bit of a torment but I have always been very pleased. I’ve become an investor in Alibaba because I believe that the way the company and the merchants on AliExpress understand how to keep costs low and value high.

Unfortunately, there have been several times when I believe that I was scammed by a store.  AliExpress however was good at helping to resolve the issue and I received my money back relatively quick.  

In the beginning using AliExpress, getting a resolution was difficult.  I think when you have become a diamond member, resolutions are quick and you get a response from customer service quickly.  

I still do not like the chat feature for resolving issues.  I understand that it is in place due to various languages spoken.  But the chat app is terrible.  

Lastly, the store that scammed me recently is still selling on AliExpress!  I thought you were going to delete that store?  There are several reviews besides mine from people who had the same experience.",2021-04-16 03:42:20,JL&C

And I don’t really buy clothes cause I’m a heavy person but I buy some for my love ones that are petite and it always looks so good on them. Super great price just be sure to read the description cause for the most part it is what it says but also if they do you dirty you can always complain and get your money back.

Granted most of my items have been toddler and baby clothes but each piece has yet to disappoint. Items take a bit of time to come but definitely not more then to be expected.

I find the sellers more reliable and the customer service helpful along with most of the products being free on shipping to be less a headache to deal with for better deals. My only complaint is that the search engine could use some work hence the four stars. I've purchased products only to find better through the related tabs that didn't show up on my search results.,2019-04-04 03:10:57,Maksu1982
896,Good but...,False,5,I highly recommend that a reply section be added to the review section! I read so many reviews and often times wanna reply to them because half the time a lot of people have no idea as to what they’re talking about and it really effects the company when it comes to people like me that look at the reviews to determine whether or not I buy an item!

They have everything from A-Z and for great prices! They are actually what they claim to be or really similar to what is advertised. I ordered 22 things for just $31 and I was only disappointed  din one item. A lot of the sellers are nice and give you free gifts.

Totally unreliable and they are rude as well. Most sellers won’t even speak English and I never received my refund. If you want something reliable go to Wish. They’ve ALWAYS answer to me in a polite and quick way and got a refund anytime I wasn’t happy with my purchase. 

I can’t believe AliExpress cares so little about their customers to believe the sellers even WHEN YOU HAVE PROOF. I’m filing a claim and hopefully get my money back and NEVER buying for this scam app AGAIN. I’ll give them a 0 if could.",2018-01-17 23:15:33,MelodyMacek
900,Purchaser,False,5,"So far I have been enjoying the buying experience from Ali express. Tell you this, if your having an issue with a vendor being scrupulously and not wanting to help you with a defective product, go an dispute it and take photos and videos of the issue and with in a week or so AliExpress will step in and resolve your issues. Stay firm and don’t deviate from the issue and AliExpress will refund you and black ball the vendor. Many Blessings to all.🙏🏻",2022-11-14 22:48:57,e-nigma1
901,My secret obsession is cruising this app for the cheap hookup ;),False,5,"Best place to cut out the middle man and buy  from whatever plug you are looking to find from electronics to clothing, just make sure they have 5 stars and over 100 orders with picture reviews, buy from anyone else and it’s on you, you’ve defly been warned. Be patient with shipping but don’t let the buyers garuntee expire or you own the cake decorators you got instead of the Jordan’s you ordered. Experienced buyer review.",2022-04-23 06:22:10,agulgowski
902,Customer Service is a SCAM!,False,1,"Their customer service is basically just a waste of your time and doesn't do anything.

I received a defective SSD drive from a seller on AliExpress. Attempted to get a refund/return it to the seller, but was ignored by them. The seller then disappeared off the platform.

Reached out to AliExpress customer service via chat in the app. The absolute worst customer service EVER!

Those representatives either cannot do anything at all, or they are instructed to ghost, distract, or otherwise ignore the customer. 

They requested evidence of the faulty product, multiple times. I've supplied several video recordings, clearly showcasing that the product was not working. 

They got back to me saying the evidence was not accepted, which is insane...!

Called their U.S. customer service number many times during their operating hours. Keeps sending me to their voicemail, and nobody every returns my calls. 

The Customer Service operates like a complete scam. 

Please beware and expect to never get your money back for total garbage products.",2022-06-11 18:37:13,Sashmir3186
903,"Great for low cost, check reviews",False,5,Have rarely ever been disappointed with items from AliExpress. They sell all kinds of cool items and gadgets that work! You just have to check the reviews to make sure they are verified sellers. The shipping takes really long because it is coming from overseas so do not expect things to come ASAP. Maybe more like 1-3 months. But the wait is worth it once you receive your items.,2022-02-15 18:02:54,Melduh
904,Impressed,False,5,I am very impressed with AliExpress all the way around! The products ship and arrive in a timely fashion telling me that other competitors is Asia are not so honest about delayed shipping etc due to the COVID issue. I’m still waiting on items I ordered in March from dh gate but AliExpress has impressed me there’s only been a couple items were they didn’t arrive or had other issue. But all products so far seem very quality to say the least!,2021-09-26 01:01:43,MsBeej73
905,Too many bait & switch sellers,False,1,"Too many sellers post a picture with very low price on the site. But when you check out the item, then they tell you the price is not for the pictured item. Also be aware of free shipping! You will found out a lot of times the item’s shipping is not free, usually with a very high shipping charges. The tracking information is not accurate. 

I ordered one item at a very attractive price. After I paid for the item, then the seller informed me that the item could not be delivered to my address and requested me to cancel the order. So disappointed. A lot of waste of time. I would not buy anything from this site anymore.",2021-12-24 19:17:16,老讀者1689
906,Good site!,False,5,"I’ve ordered several times from Ali and like it! It takes a long time to get stuff but you just have to know/plan for it. I like getting some party things through here! Recently got swimsuits. Have gotten kids clothes. On clothes, adjust your expectations a little bit- I’ve liked what I’ve gotten but it is still a cheaper version sometimes. Look at reviews and pictures! Definitely worth looking at their stuff!!",2021-04-11 15:14:50,Emkate24
907,Customer Service is out of reach,False,3,"The app is quite sophisticated in processing orders, but absolutely has no contact options for customer service. Their virtual assistant Eva is operating on generic questions/answers and cannot look outside of the box. She responds with generic links. If shopper has problems with some store’s customer service, there is no one to contact. Amazing that such billion dollars operating site doesn’t have basic human customer service department where we can call or email. For me customer service is the most important operating part of any retail business.",2021-09-21 09:38:01,Vie R.
908,Im trying to shop less,False,4,"I used to order so much from here when everything was way cheaper and it wasn’t a popular app! Now everything is almost about the same price as if you would just buy it from the US but some things are still cheaper to buy it from here. So would still definitely recommend checking the price on here first. 

I like buying random things on here that aren’t so expensive and on my free time that sometimes I need to limit myself cx",2021-08-12 01:56:00,Janni💖
909,Seems scary at first but once you learn it’s great.,False,5,At first I thought this was a sketchy site because some prices seem too good to be true and in some cases it is. But once I learned how it worked it’s a must have app to have. Many shoppers leave reviews and even pictures of their received items in case you aren’t sure of how it looks. Tracking is ok for most items. Shipping is a drag but some prices are worth it. Hope this helps.,2021-03-24 17:53:02,ConstantThunder
910,Great app for Shopping,False,5,"I use Aliexpress all the time! It’s great for finding the little things but also clothing and homewares for a (usually) much more affordable price than most other places I would look. Would definitely recommend, the only downside sometimes is that shipping takes a little longer, but if you’re willing to wait or order things in advance of when you need them, it’ll work for you!",2020-12-24 13:22:35,teacats and bunnies
911,AliExpress is far better than I originally thought it would be,False,5,"Definitely worth checking out. Things can be hit or miss but you can't really go wrong. It's my go-to for things I don't need right away. I've received some things after a week and others after a few months. During the pandemic it’s to be expecting with a lot of things so if you can stand the waiting, it’s well worth it. I also make sure to check reviews. I depend on them heavily. Just a tip.",2020-08-23 02:58:16,Kasi15
912,Good combination of stuff,False,5,"AliExpress seems to be the interface for ordering for inexpensive items in fixed low quantity selection.
So if you need a single item, not 1000 of something, you can order easily.
All of the merchants I have dealt with place customer satisfaction first, not sure if that is government directed ( ugly concept if true)or just the way it is happening.
Lead times seem extended on some items unless you change shipping methods, but that is part of dealing with international companies.",2019-09-08 16:50:16,dadolson
913,Takes the ligit longest,False,1,"I went to Ali because people said ok SHEIN to go here and I said ok. I was so excited because I was shopping for online middle school, I liked it because lots of the things were cheap. So when I bought some items I was excited cause of how to showed it’ll ship, instead it showed 89 days to deliver I said well that’s only one but the other was 89 days too I didn’t really bother cause i had like 3 other items but all of them had 89 days😑. I’m really inpatient so I was really upset cause it’ll come when school already started😑. If your patient it’ll be easier. BUT IF YOUR NOT AND YOUR IN USA I don’t think you should get some items cause I think this was made in China or something",2020-06-08 16:29:57,Literally takes 89 days
914,10 inches of Lovely highlights,False,4,I loved the hair ! Gorgeous blonde highlights in 10 inch light brown hair 😍 I love it . Although I did bleach the knots and and wash it first before applying . I didn’t actually pluck the hair at all when taken this picture .my hair came exactly like that . The best part is it’s super soft. The only problem was the delay in delivery but it ended up coming on time so they were up to day with updated me but at first the DHL delivery time was a bit late but then it came a week earlier so that was perfect ! In all I’d order more hair from the company . I got so many compliments,2020-05-29 01:53:33,Miracle Clay
915,Be careful!!,False,3,"I’ve ordered 2 things in October. It’s now December neither has made it to my home. They seem to be “lost in customs” per the sellers. Be very careful when ordering and read reviews. I order gifts in October thinking they would arrive by Christmas, WRONG. No tracking updates, sellers extend “protection” to protect themselves no the buyer. Now I have to wait an additional two weeks to file a claim about my missing packages. How can packages sit in a Chinese facility for almost 2 months?! Tracking has the items in China as the 17th of November. I used to never have this problem, now it seems I never get anything I order.",2019-12-20 14:00:15,I don't want men's clothing!
916,Endless options and good pricing!!,False,5,"The App makes it so easy to use. You can track your products, deal with any problems, ask all of your questions and leave reviews with no complications at all. I am very pleased with it! I have been buying things here for several years. There seems to be endless options for whatever you are looking for. If you take your time and do your homework on the products you can get some great things and save a bunch of money.",2019-04-09 00:32:11,Jonnyboy51401
917,Love this app,False,5,I have used this app for a month or two now and can’t spend a lot of money on items because of financial problems. But everything I’ve bought has been just what I wanted and thankfully I have no complaints on broken items. Plus I received all things before it said I would!! Which is always AWESOME!! so just read reviews before u buy from a certain seller and you will love this app too!,2022-11-11 03:09:07,steph ryan
918,Disappointed,False,2,"I ordered several things from this web site.  Most were pretty nice, but my largest purchase never arrived, the post office returned it to seller.  AliExpress wouldn’t refund the purchase.  It clearly stated on website that my order was returned to seller by postal service.  So the seller was given back order, lost nothing and I wasn’t given a refund.  A couple sellers on the site clearly mislead you.  I got a princess dress too & though it was nice for price it clearly was not the dress shown on site.  It is a gamble to order.  My suggestion is don’t order from sellers without a high rating, even then it is a bit dicey.  If you are not willing to lose money, shop somewhere else.",2018-10-18 16:11:09,tobadusa
919,AliExpress deliver 100% satisfaction to date,False,5,"Hight recommend as an alternative and cheaper way to buy items. Shipping may take awhile for some items depending on how much you are willing to pay for shipping but I’ve received all items I’ve bought so far from them and they are all as advertised. Look for the highly rated sellers and give them a try, I’m sure you won’t be disappointed. Five stars for me so far! 👍🏽",2022-08-21 19:12:39,Gadjetlady
920,AMAZING,False,5,It literally has everything that you can think and ask for the Quality of products is very good and you have a A lot of options to choose from. The only thing that would probably be irritating is the shipping because it does come from China (most of the stuff )and it may take a minute for your things to come depending on what you buy but besides that everything is amazing.,2022-05-27 03:34:59,litjj414
921,LOVE AliExpress,False,5,"I buy so many things from here… I swear it’s better than wish, or any other online shopping like that. 

 The only things I can even complain about are that I don’t like how when I confirm item delivery, and I don’t have time to review right away, but I want to keep confirming, it makes me go back to my account page. I have to keep going back in and scrolling down. 

The other thing is, they limit the amount of lists you can have. I’m a list maker, and planner, so it’s frustrating to me. 

I also don’t like when a seller shows a product, you click it, and there’s a random item for that price, and the thing you wanted is much more. I don’t think AliExpress should let them do that. I don’t buy from anyone who does that. I’m automatically annoyed.",2022-01-01 10:29:27,mckatej
922,Search words and no actual person to contact,False,3,I love this site but trying to search for something pulls up stuff that isn’t even remotely close to what you are looking for. Also if you receive a package that wasn’t what you ordered there is no actual person to talk to. I think the package wasn’t even supposed to come up me and so far I am not missing any as of it was switched. Hard to open a dispute about something you didn’t order and the numbers on the package aren’t any of the numbers you can search for,2022-03-11 14:12:40,frogger123456
923,Tons of wholesale goods,False,4,It’s a tad confusing when u first buy. The app won’t let u get goods u like that are first time buyer when it’s a discount so u are limited on the first purchase. Everything is from a different supplier so u are dealing with different delivery times. Some bi shipping n some don’t. It can get a bit annoying. N since u have goods coming from different suppliers u don’t always know what u will get quality wise. However tons on selection on this site. N good prices if u only go with free shipping supplies.,2022-01-14 06:55:35,beccalc15

But be aware than you Need to look at reviews, and make sure there are at least a couple good pictures of the product in the reviews, taken by customers. If you adhere to this rule you shouldn’t face any problems, and aside from sometimes having long wait times, there are no other downsides. Overall I recommend!!",2021-05-13 18:50:31,alli.otaku

Orders a few things, and was chosen for a free jacket  paid my little monies and waited, I get alerts oh it’s close, and the should arrive by these date notifications. Well it didn’t and I waited a little longer and nothing. I’m very disappointed because I really thought AliExpress was doing a great job!

933,Could use work,False,4,"Bought many Michael Jackson items from this app. I didn’t put 5 stars cause the shipping can take forever plus I bought Michael Jackson shoes and they were way too big. I returned them but they never got to the seller. The seller was very immature about it and got zero refund for it and not even another size shoe. But besides that I would say it is pretty nice for all the beginning MJ Impersonators out there, it’s not all “real” leather, mostly suede. I got most of my Impersonator\Fan items here.

936,Couldn’t be happier!,False,5,I’ve been purchasing products from Alibaba for years. This is the first time that I am running over here. I couldn’t be happier with the order. The representative replied promptly and was very friendly. I also received my order much sooner than I expected. The quality of all the products I purchase was amazing.

941,Not that great but you get what you pay for,False,3,"Have had a few problems on orders. Didn’t get about half of them. Still never got a refund on one of them. Still arguing with that shop seller but they won’t replace or refund. 
Some the sellers are great but if it says it’s coming from over seas don’t expect the item to even show up. Make sure it’s going to have tracking on it is best too. A lot from one place, tracking ends at its customs and no updates after that. But orders from in states come fast. No problems with orders from Europe area ether.",2021-05-20 21:52:14,StoneZone79

The watch strap is too short, 1 watch was was completely the wrong watch (or not as advertised) and the last watch ($150) the bezel has sharp edges and the bezel color is much lighter than what is shown in the website pictures ( not as advertised)... I have requested a refund for the wrong watch so let’s see what kind of customer service AliExpress provides.

943,My thoughts..,False,5,"I can’t fight it anymore, I have to just accept it, I’m obsessed with Aliexpress. 
Just make sure whenever you are searching for items, to filter free shipping options. Or, make sure the item you want, isn’t selling w free shipping (meaning cheaper)from a different seller. Cuz the shipping is how they will get you, you think you’re buying a 2 dollar item, but you don’t notice they’re charging you 15 bucks for shipping. Just a tip☺️",2021-02-18 02:29:54,roxybaby17

A seller didn’t ship an item I had bought but it was no problem once I contacted them they shipped ASAP. I really love it. One problem I noticed is after I get my daily coins I cannot see any of the penny + coin items. Hope this will help that. I’m always going to check this app out, be careful it’s slightly addicting.

I highly recommend this seller and will use them again in the future! Thank you.",2020-12-08 17:02:14,menaca3
946,Safe and lots to buy,False,5,"I’ve bought a lot of things from AliExpress. There is no need to worry about purchases because the seller doesn’t get paid until you accept the item. Most of the things advertised on Instagram are from this site. The exact same pics and you can get for a lot less here. Wait is longer but worth it! The couple of times I didn’t get what I ordered I had no problem getting my money back.

947,Customer site review,False,4,"A little hard to navigate the site but if you familiarize yourself with the app and the language to English translation it’s okay.  Some vendors don’t ship until they get close to the deadline to ship which causes delays in the receipt of goods.  If you are willing to wait for product, the prices are great.  Quality on most items received are quite satisfactory.  It would be helpful if all vendors would picture their fabrics with a ruler, so customer can gauge if the size of the pattern is appropriate for what they are making.",2020-10-25 10:19:25,cci808
948,Love AliExpress,False,5,"I find cute novelty items all the time on AliExpress. Many of which are super cheap compared to what you may find the the stores, given it does take a couple months to receive packages I believe the price is worth it. Also, AliExpress has great customer service. I never feel like I am taking a risk on purchasing things since they have: package tracking, direct communication messages with the seller, package warranty– and if you are still unsatisfied– you can start a dispute.",2020-07-01 15:45:51,emaqin

One packages leaked, but hopefully I’ll have enough.  I liked the inventory sheet, I liked the split paper cover.  The drills looked pretty good. My only complaint is the fact that it should have been mailed in a longer box so that the edges of the canvas weren’t folded over to make it fit.  Other than that 5 stars!! Excellent. I would order from you again!! Very happy!!",2019-10-10 18:10:31,Confetka
950,You’ve gotta love the prices!,False,4,"If you are discerning enough about the quality of the reviews, you’ll find that there are definitely some great items on here at amazing prices. For the most part, nothing is name brand. So when it comes to things that I don’t need “name brand” for, AliExpress is often the way to go. I also like to browse through the suggested items. The app is pretty intuitive about recommending things that I’m interested in. I’d give five stars if I trusted the reviews or if I was able to purchase name brand items.",2019-12-06 04:36:53,hickmancase

My husband was amazed by it, going from a basic mechanical keyboard to this one he was blown away! He loves how it lights up the letters that he uses on his comp. games, my favorite part is the changing lights. If you need a new keyboard this is the place to buy it!

At first i was skeptical about ordering from here but i’d say if you read the product reviews ( look at pictures as well if there are any) and check the store ratings you’ll be fine. One thing to note is that since the products are coming in from china it’ll take a while so if you’re not bothered by that then i think you should definitely purchase from here. The prices are incredibly cheap too! :),2019-09-06 20:57:15,yoochie
953,Great App!!,False,5,"If you don’t mind waiting a little extra time to receive your purchases this app is for you!! I’ve made my fair share of purchases and have been very pleased all in all! Very rarely I’ve come across some kind of issue. The sellers I have had to contact have been very nice to work with and have been extremely helpful to remedy the situation, I’ve never had a problem that wasn’t taken care of to my satisfaction!! Thank you! I look forward to future purchases!!",2019-03-24 21:43:43,Terbear968
954,Definitely recommend but some cons,False,5,"This app is a great app! Has basically everything that you need but far as shipping, it’s very slow. But it could be depending on the sealer...but far as with my experience all of my orders took a month..month in a half just to be delivered. So if you’re looking for something for a special event I’d recommend you ordering it months before or buying the items in stores. Other than that, the prices are low and reasonable! Products are legit!",2019-03-11 21:24:34,Brianaa'96
955,Seller messed me up and no refund,False,2,I have been doing some transactions on this platform for sometime now but my biggest scam was when I tried to purchase wedding invitation card for my big day which was schedule for last year December of which the cards did not arrive that time so I couldn’t use it. This arrived in my country 2nd week in January so it became useless for the purpose intended for. So the seller and I agreed that I should ask for refund from then he stopped responding to my messages and also removed the item from his shop so there is no trace of the review I made on the item. Till now he has never responded to my messages. The name of the shop is F&X Warm Love World Shop,2019-03-16 10:38:59,Shermill
956,Best shopping app!!,False,5,"This app is the 1 go to I check everyday without fail. Regardless of where the product ships from, it is extremely faster than Wish!! I have switched recently, due to their security policies, and lack of anti theft provisions! Their products are all guaranteed if it is questionable and tracking always available. I order all my gifts, and anything for holidays early enough to get them in time. Define get this app if your questioning about it. You will not be disappointed!!",2019-01-30 01:37:06,3Dseeker
957,"Surprisingly, not a scam.  It’s good marketplace.",False,4,"In fact, this is a quality place to buy cheap items.  I especially use the app for watches and all of them work even months after purchase.  $2.00 for a watch that works for upwards of 6 months?  Yes, please!

They do a fantastic job with handling scams.  However, you do beed to still be careful.  You can’t expect them to catch everything.  Some things do still make it through.  Luckily, AliExpress does not give away your information to the sellers.  I genuinely trust this company with my transactions.",2019-03-03 16:56:08,Travis Magnus
958,AliExpress review,False,5,"I like this app, it’s easy and fun to shop and buy. Shipping rates are very fairly priced. Great prices on many products. My order took about 3 weeks to arrive. I will continue to buy in the near future. When I have a question about a product AliExpress reply’s quickly and professionally. I enjoy searching for items that I need and want. I enjoy finding gift’s to give to friends and family. Great site for men’s wrist watches.",2022-07-17 19:18:28,RomanRod
959,I like it,False,1,"So far everything I purchase off here is good no complaints, a couple of things I purchased were good others I never received Update 5/6/21 When a app has items you pay big money for so cheap beware …everything is from China and if you select 7 day shipping it’s rare you actually get your item within that time frame it’s more like 60 days and not to mention the sellers lie about items you purchased and they ship the wrong items that you always get stuck with because you don’t get to talk to anyone but biots it’s all fake be careful ordering off of her…disregard my previous statement I learned a lesson to many from AliExpress",2022-10-25 13:27:09,Tas1850
960,A True Fan of Ali’s!!,False,5,I love shopping at Ali’s. It may take a while to get the items but the savings is worth the wait! I love the wide variety of items they have and shipping is free or very inexpensive depending on what you are buying. I didn’t care for the car seat covers I bought and I’m going to take a loss on those since I’m sure returns are not an easy process. But all in all I will continue to shop on their website for great savings!!,2022-05-09 22:13:50,jvilla727
961,My new favorite shopping app,False,5,"AliExpress has everything you could ever want. And many more things you never knew you needed or wanted. So far all of the products I have received have been of great quality. Shipping can vary as many things are made to order. If you have the time and can wait for shipping, I suggest you try them out. You cannot beat their prices by buying direct from the manufacturer.",2022-03-29 22:33:48,Maddux2008
962,Nice and chip stuff,False,5,Some times I see some stuff and other stores so expensive I said no no no I goin to find that an Ali Express some times the stores send different things than you order is a little complicate abobe the size and numbers and take some little time for shipping when I'm not in a hurry for things I order them here and if I don't I try to order them in time I always fine good deals and good things thanks Ali express,2021-08-19 22:12:08,SURY M

Buy with PayPal or make sure that you use a credit card and remember, keep communication open and do a charge back or dispute the transaction (in order to get your money back) within 60 days DESPITE if the seller swears that it is on its way and to trust them.

I get so much stuff from every category and I love how cheap it can be.

I’m addicted.",2021-05-03 18:31:41,snazzyhoneypunnywit
965,Addressing the negative,False,5,Honestly AliExpress is a great app for cheaper foreign made products and I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with it yet I see nothing but negative feedback about the app. AliExpress can take longer than expected but that has not been the case for me and if you just look over a product and who the seller is you can identify whether it’s a scam or not. In conclusion AliExpress is as good as any other eBay type apps and I 100% recommend it to anyone who likes good deals.,2020-11-22 00:31:31,OgMattBone
966,Terrible customer service,False,1,"It’s an app to buy cheap stuff from Asia. As long as you have that in mind it’s OK, I had bought lots of cheap stuff from Asia and some of it was poor quality and broke quickly some of it was good. The worst experience I’ve ever had though was when I ordered some clothing and there were supposed to be four items in the package there was only three I contacted the seller - nothing - result I put in an appeal and Ali express sided with the vendor. They won’t talk to me explain to me or do anything to make it right. Avoid this app - avoid this company there’s lots of other ones out there that will get you the same stuff the same price or better.",2021-02-20 02:23:13,unhappy in arlington

The seller is not responding to my messages , there is no tracking information at all . O ordered stuff at the end of august it is now December and slowly approaching 2021 and I have not received nothing else after my first 3 packages . Then the sellers that do respond is lying . Saying that my packages is at my local post office but when I called the post office is saying they never received anything for me . Then when I ask for a refund I’m thinking I would get it ASAP but I’m also still waiting for that . Sorry but I think this is pretty messaged up I could’ve spent my $100 somewhere else",2020-12-04 17:59:24,Cookie doooeeee

969,Pleaseant Surprise,False,5,"Great app with incredible prices and completely professional sellers. Products have been great and sometimes even better than expected. The sellers deliver as or sooner than promised. Whenever I had questions for sellers, they’ve always provided prompt and thorough answers. The only downside to app: Since many items ship from overseas and pass through customs, delivery can take a few weeks so make sure you’re aware of lead time before purchasing.",2020-02-01 18:22:53,lgkfelsm
970,Love it!!!,False,5,"This app is great and a good portion for less expensive items. The only thing I won’t recommend is to purchase personal items like panties,bra, boxers and also cosmetics. Depending on the seller you get, items may arrive quickly especially hair. Mostly 3 days. But other sellers take a while to deliver items. So just read the reviews before purchase. If no reviews on most items, then seller is prolly scam. Trustworthy sellers always have reviews whether good or bad. Great app just be careful.",2020-01-14 17:41:17,Obaa S
971,GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED AT FRACTION RETAIL PRICE,False,5,"I use this app for basically everything! I love the everything that’s offered in one app! From Christmas gifts, birthday gifts, everyday items, fun items, gaming items, furniture, etc, it all you need in fraction of retail price. 

Also, You get to message the supplier directly, which is really convenient. Although sometimes orders do take about a month, most of my orders I’ve received in less than 3 weeks. But what would you expect, most suppliers are from China and I’m in the U.S.

972,You can find great deals if you make sure to check reviews,False,5,I really enjoy buying my nail art supplies on AliExpress.  you can find great deals IF you make sure to do your research (each seller is different and a few sellers might sell the same item at different price points) and CHECK THE REVIEWS. Don’t skip that! It will show you what the item is really like and whether it’s worth buying. All in all I enjoy using AliExpress over Wish or EBay for nail supplies as there is SO much variety!,2019-12-01 00:53:21,Crazyforphotos

974,If you get your order be happy if it’s correct,False,1,"I’m done with AliExpress. There are but 3 sellers I would buy from ever again. I have been ripped off so many times by sellers and AliExpress isn’t like eBay where you are protected. Remember they are overseas and they rarely describe products appropriately. You can ask them beforehand and they can outright lie to you. You may receive an empty package, the wrong item, cheap quality or broken items and guess what? Yep you’re out the money. Don’t even consider filing a dispute with your bank unless you want to be banned permanently from AliExpress so in other words you are the rich wealthy westerners whom should accept the financial hit. Be warned if you make purchases it’s a Buyer Beware scenario. Good luck.",2019-02-01 20:46:03,RockSolidRC
975,Love it!,False,4,"This app is really nice! You can find most anything here and the things are a good price and sometimes really cheap. You can also earn coins and get coupons to spend on certain items. The only thing is that I couldn't use my select coupons that I won in their games so they just expired. You can use ones that you redeem with coins though, just not ones you win, which is a problem. But overall it’s really nice and I would definitely recommend.

The lady said they were having issues with the website saying unable to process payment due to security reasons and to file a appeal and send information in. I was also told not to worry she will appeal it and take care of the problem. She said give them 48 hrs to fix the problem. Make a long story short it was never done!  Be aware of this site.

But anytime you purchase multiple items from different Sellers on the same day, you run the risk of items not being in the package that they consolidated or an item you didn’t purchase being added. Don’t purchase multiple items on the same day. They won’t make it right.",2022-04-02 13:26:18,Buffy12863

My iPad is mounted to a stand and I have to completely dismount it to be able to use it vertically. Otherwise I have to deal with seeing everything sideways and worse yet, trying to type sideways. It’s late 2021, get it together AliExpress. This is not something that should even be an issue.

988,Existing features good || Needs More Consideration,False,4,"The AliExpress app makes it easy to make purchases, explore new trends and get product info. The multiple features aimed at fulfilling theses tasks are neat and polished. 

However, there is a lack of features to support the consumer. Everything is geared to favor the vendors and make it difficult for customers to file claims in regards to orders. This ties in with the overall AliExpress track record of suppressing the buyer while prioritizing its vendors.

I set up a dispute for a refund and they said I had to pay for shipping which was over half the money I spent on the product. I usually don’t write negative reviews but the fact I lost money over a lost package is ridiculous and I do not recommend buying from here even if it’s supposed to save money.

She wants me to cancel and choose the option stating that I just don’t want to product anymore, which isn’t true. I wanted the product.

Please make the coupons a fair game, something you can use on any product at any price. Other than that, wonderful app with good deals on a large scale of products that I highly recommend.",2020-04-05 08:37:36,DocAmfl
1006,Great buys for scrapbooking projects at great prices.,False,5,"I wish there was an easier way to see if the product one is looking at can be purchased with PayPal. Also, once I find a Seller whose products I like, I wish I could figure out how to purchase more from them. There is probably a way but I haven’t figured it out yet. Maybe this could be accomplished with a Sort feature. Love the site and always purchase my scrapbook supplies here due to price. Worth the waiting time.",2019-10-12 13:58:55,pollillop
1007,Gotta have AliExpress!!!!,False,5,"If you haven’t added this one to your library of apps, this is a MUST!! I love this app. They have everything you could imagine and at a super good price....Unlike WISH, where prices are constantly inflating...
AliExpress has way better offers and in my opinion most sellers offer much faster shipping! They even had a very specific ben10 costume my 6yr old had been begging me for and that I couldn’t find anywhere else!! But AliExpress had it.... and much much more!!!!!",2018-06-03 00:49:23,dalmassoapts

The sellers are very kind and stay in good contact with you. It does take longer to ship, however, it does describe it will take a prolonged amount of time, but many smaller items come in early. The price, products, and accountability for is app is amazing! I definitely recommend this app.",2018-04-20 03:06:18,natalie_365
1010,Shopping app,False,4,Some things a prices great and some the same or similar as buying here in USA .. you have to be willing to take a risk if there is a problem or you don’t like. There is a very small window to report problems to resolve. I have had success and some disappointment but I don’t buy too expensive things just in case. The prices are good but you have to have patience to wait 3/4/5 weeks for your purchase. Order then a week plus to ship then travel time delivery time. It’s nice people can post pics that helps .,2018-05-02 02:56:17,Enet805
1011,3 PLUS YEARS OF SAVING $$$,False,5,"Ok i found your app over 3 yrs ago after i had to apply for disability and quit my job and your app literally saved me so much money i was able to celebrate holidays, birthdays, kids parties and regular household items and clothing and stuff to resell to make money to buy groceries so i THANK YOU!

(ie., clothes, hair stuff, jewelry, some electronic items, makeup, hats, decorations, cell phone and ipad accessories, makeup stuff, shoes, etc. etc. etc. If l’m shopping online or in the mall, l then look for it on AliExpress (or WISH).

1013,Good prices!,False,5,"I love aliexpress. Specifically the shoes. 

I have gotten amazing platform boots for as little as 28 dollars. I use them anytime I go out, have for more than 6 months and they have not been broken or even a little damaged! They still work the same as always. 

I recently ordered some shoes for 38 dollars and the size came in too small, a lot of stores use Asian sizes (like 39, 40, etc) so make sure you search up what would ur size be in that department. 

I was afraid when I applied to return it that they would take my money but they did not! I returned the shoes (mind you, for free. Although some stores don’t offer free returns) and got back my money.

All in all great store with cheap prices! Make sure you but things with the most reviews and pictures.",2022-02-09 01:36:59,grandmashappy
1014,Creepy Advertisements,False,3,"Great prices and all, I’ve been using this app for years. I’ve had a couple accounts throughout the years, but it sometimes suggests overly sexual items in the advertisements, things labeled such as “cross dressing”, so as a man can pretend to be a woman, etc., while I’m a natural-born lady…? I’m not judging if that’s your thing, but I haven’t searched anything that would relate, and I don’t often see an option to remove these suggestions from the screen. So, not the most child friendly, but that may be self-explanatory. Thanks !",2022-03-19 16:47:53,meadowvh

1019,Great app,False,5,Everything works close to perfection except sometimes the notifications in my orders don’t show up on my iPhones main screen up in the corner of the icon. I have to open the app and click “orders” and then I will see there were updates in my orders. So if the devs can have it so it notifies us every time there’s an update in the orders this app would be perfect. Overall I’m quite happy with this app’s GUI and functions properly. No bugs for how I use it. Good work devs!,2020-06-10 18:21:42,cmj141

It actually came earlier than the day it was supposed to which was great. I dyed the hair from blonde to red and it curls slightly when wet and is so soft. I will definitely order from here again. Once I curl the hair or flat iron it, I am sure it will look even better than it’s natural state which is how it is in my pictures.",2019-08-23 01:54:13,naedee
1021,Customer Service,False,5,"I am satisfied with app, but initially I thought I had an issue with my order and it was not easy to ask the questions I needed to ask through the app. My review would be different if the remainder of my order had not arrived two days later.

The stores I have ordered from have provided great service and surprisingly fast shipping .

1023,Yes! Saving money!,False,5,"Patience is rewarded! The app is easy to use and seller readings are very clear. I have been able to buy many different items that are of good quality and crazy, crazy affordable prices. 

Others may knock products made in China, but 80% of what is in your home is made in China and these products are just as good. I have also seen products on this app that are not available in stores near me. 

Overall, I am extremely extremely happy.",2019-07-10 00:21:04,DuskyJewel
1024,Great website with quality products and quick shipping,False,5,"I highly recommend AliExpress.  I have ordered from Wish for at least two years. AliExpress offers many items with free shipping (from China mostly) but their shipping transit time is about one week.  I have been amazed at AliExpress’ customer service, professional vendors and overall my “go-to shopping” website. If I could give a ten star rating, I would!  You will not be disappointed.",2019-05-29 01:10:16,I Love Bentwood!
1025,Great !!,False,5,"I’ve ordered 3 times now from different sellers and every thing has been fine and I’ve had no issues. Just sometimes shipping takes forever but at the most so far only about a month depending on where you buy it from. Make sure you check the ratings your seller has to insure a quality experience. Overall is cool, and there is some neat stuff that would be expensive somewhere else and is good quality. I recommend!",2019-03-19 00:18:06,_typical_girl_1
1026,Warning for shopping addicts 😄,False,5,"As people previously mentioned, the app can “trap” you for days! It’s like Santa’s bag here. They got stuff you would not dream about. The prices are amazing. You could make good money reselling some of the items. Only downside is the looong delivery time for free or standard shipping, about 2 months. But who am I to complain about a good bargain, right? Also you can get discount coupons. For example you buy $5 worth or more and get $4 off the total. Now that’s a good deal!",2018-07-06 09:42:42,AppleToday.info
1027,Just like wish and geek. -,False,1,"I personally wouldn’t waste my time done loading it considering it’s just like wish and geek. 
Not to mention when I was scrolling through it I found soooo many knock offs of high brand makeup. And, I wouldn’t trust buying knockoff makeup, because it could contain harmful chemicals, and you have no idea what you’re putting on your face. 
Other than that, it has cool stuff on here (like wish and geek), but in reality most of the stuff is probably gonna be cheaply made; because it is cheap. 
So, yeah. That’s just what I think about this app. I think it’s basically like wish and geek, 80% of the make up is gonna be knockoffs if high brands, and it’s probably gonna be hit or miss when you buy something.",2018-09-18 01:58:53,Wouldnt download it

Some things take a while, but for items I can’t buy in my lical stores I can be patient. Some of the very best quality denim clothing have I got from Ali express.

The advice I can give always read others reviews and see what there experiences have been when they purchase and that way you’ll feel a bit secure when ordering. If I don’t see reviews on a item I don’t order . Most things I’ve order takes about 2 weeks to 3 weeks😕",2022-11-28 22:54:51,maliejo34

It takes about 2 months per package (which is great for s vendor from China to the United States)Alibaba wasn’t as good and was confusing and taobao was completely Chinese and everything was confusing. I would say if you are trying to find Chinese vendors, aliexpress is the best one.. but also, the 15 day refund thing is trash. The shipment takes a couple months and the refund time is up.",2022-09-10 17:53:22,purplegamer8389
1032,Cheap but shipping price and the time things take to arrive really bring the quality down,False,4,There are so many cute and affordable things on here but the shopping price and tax makes it very expensive. I’m lowkey just BROKE.. but still. And it normally takes 2-4 months to arrive which is frustrating especially if you want to buy a birthday gift or smth.

I only wish shipping was faster because sometimes I need a product quickly. However, if you can wait for items, it’s well worth the effort.

If you made a mistake sending ( your real address) not the one that ali express trying to force ) and with that address you have your carrier phone. Bam you get banned !

I’ve purchased things like patches and accessories with good success, even when I’ve needed orders to be canceled prior to shipping. Buying any clothing or size-reliant accessories poses a big risk. Pay close attention to the materials used, as some vendors offer extremely poorly made products.

All in all the clothes this app sells are pretty good quality. They’re a cheap price and cheap material, but it all depends on what shop u buy from. Definitely read the reviews of products before u buy something",2021-06-04 14:01:47,Kittycass333
1041,Love this app,False,5,There is so much to choose from on this app it’d take days to get through it all. Most of the items have been true to their description that I’ve bought. Some pictures are very deceiving showing  items in sizes far beyond the actual size so pay attention to descriptions.

Sometimes the shipping is slow because the stuff comes from China but it’s worth it because the clothes and bathing suits are so cute ! My advice, DO NOT buy anything until you’ve read reviews WITH pictures. Otherwise you might not get what you paid for.

During Covid-19, shipping times were even slower but I still got my packages.",2020-07-30 05:51:23,IG: monaemodel
1046,Ali express,False,5,Save a little money as long as you’re willing to wait. The only problem I have is that you order something then three months later it never comes I have always got a refund so no problem there it’s just the fact that you wait three months for nothing. That’s not fun. It’s not a everyday thing maybe 10-15 percent of my orders but hoping Ali can fix that maybe.  It’s definitely the the worst draw back to there site.,2020-05-20 06:38:55,Thegreenjedi

The only thing that I don’t like is that shipping times can be long. But I am usually satisfied with my purchases. The app is set up great and easy to use. Has many great features I use to find exactly what I want. If shipping could be faster I would give this a 5 star. But it’s still an awesome app if you are looking to wholesale as well.,2020-07-25 02:33:23,MorgMoney
1048,Great App!,False,5,I am always satisfied with my purchases. I appreciate that we can post pictures of the products we purchase when giving feedback. They have improved so much. The app service is so convenient. Makes browsing and purchasing products so easy.

I sent pictures of the damaged item and requested either a refund or an exchange.  The AliExpress customer service confirmed the damage after seeing the pictures but responded with a $23 refund as their resolutionor less than 10% of the original value of the item I paid.  This is unacceptable because what can I do with a damaged item and the refund doesn’t allow me to purchase a replacement one.  So buyer beware and purchase items at your own risk!  If the item is not what you expected or is broken, don’t expect a refund or exchange!",2020-03-30 17:28:51,DucatiRacer717
1050,Some is garbage,False,3,Very cheap items are garbage. Be careful when nobody write (words) a review yet. AliExpress automatically gives 5 Stars to the items. Buy only from stores with score 97% or more. When buying clothes or shoes make sure the seller has local return. It appears under shipping info. The most of the time is better buy one size up. Sizing is not accurate. Ask the seller before buy. BEWARE the return label is valid 7 days. You must provide a tracking number within 7 days. Their customer service is bad. Do not believe the seller offering for compensation. Claim by AliExpress.,2019-10-31 19:04:06,kvmvm

Sometimes they put 2 similar things together and if you don’t read, you could pay more than you though. It’s not deceptive, you just have to pay attention.

Hair came soft and odor free my first photos are fresh out the box no plucking just cut the lace. I’ve since dyed the hair to lighten it up (not drastically) I did use bleaching powder. Color took lovely I condition with silicone mix hair is still soft holds a good press no tangling as of yet. I did have to pluck this bad baby it’s thick as heck (true to density) since plucking and dying I have experienced shedding when I brush but not to crazy.

A little shedding and knotting that you could get out with water , flat irons or conditioners is nothing to me.

Beyond the insanely cheap things you can find absolutely anything on this site and you won’t find a better price any were else. 

Quality might as well be garenteed because if you get something that broken, cheaply made. Or just plain not what you ordered? They respond back so quickly and kindly. Refunds are almost always an option and if it not they are quick to send out a new product to you with no questions asked, just simply send a photo to verify your claim! I am obsessed to say the least!

My order automatically was sent to my old address across the country. The website suggested I contact the vendor to request an address change, which I could not do until I downloaded the app. I did request an address change very soon after I ordered but the vendors response the next day was to thank me for my business and to let them know if I had any questions.

Excellent sellers and products but do your research for quantity and price. Easy to use, easy to shop & pay. This is one of my most favorites; however, disputable cases are time consuming and difficult to get service.

1060,Great reviews,False,5,"I love this app because they sell things for cheap and from since I started ordering stuff tell now, I haven’t had any broken or damaged things and hopefully never will. The only thing I do not like is that your items take so long to come and sometimes come later than the due date. Sometimes it comes early or 2 to 3 days from the start date it should arrive.",2021-05-31 12:31:15,Mishajanette
1061,The Bomb,False,5,I ordered my wig last Thursday and received it the following Tuesday. The seller kept in touch with me the entire time. I even received the alert for delivery options from the seller before hearing from DHL. I have waited years for a T4613 wig. This one looks great and looks like it won’t take a lot of work to get it runway ready!! I will definitely order from them again. Now seller please do this same T4613 in water wave.

1063,Customer service,False,3,"Customer service is very bad!! If you cannot communicate with sellers,and  the administration doesn’t solve your problems, Example: I never received an item I order so I asked for a refund, they told me to return the items and they will give me my money back.. but again I DIDNT RECEIVED THE ITEM..and even though I try to make them understand still I couldn’t get my money back. You guys should hire competent people as customer service and not only robots who send you a predetermined answer! And allowing only honest sellers!!",2021-02-11 05:08:27,Yoshiko Solano
1064,I like it,False,5,"I have bought many items here. Most of the time, everything is worked out well. Occasionally the items do not arrive. Only once or twice Has the seller replaced the item.

For the most part, what I receive is usually what I ordered. Haven’t had a problem yet and I’ve been a loyal member. If you can’t find it anywhere else, you can find it here.

The app is great, some of the price be too high for semi-good quality items, but other than that it’s a great app to shop on. I was surprised that this app is a Chinese app, and majority of the items come from China. I love that, I watch a lot of Chinese dramas, and they have these products in the dramas, and I wanted to purchase it. so it’s great to know I can purchase this things seen from the dramas from AliExpress.",2020-07-18 05:10:25,heyeueh

I know some people have bad experiences but that's because some people just don't read they get so excited to purchase the item they've been looking for that they can forget to look at ratings.

1069,Great app to order inexpensive quality items with free or inexpensive shipping!!!,False,5,"Everything I’ve ordered has been high quality, inexpensive, and has had either free or very cheap shipping. It does take anywhere from 2-4 weeks to receive your order, but the wait is worth it! In my opinion, this app is cheaper than Wish because of the shipping charges! They have a lot of the same items and when I compare pricing, AliExpress is always cheaper!",2019-03-31 18:54:55,rachelwade1210
1070,Caution on clothing,False,3,"I have used this app about two years now I find it quite good to order cheaper things but I would caution buying anything especially the clothing that’s over 40 or $50 it does not fit like US clothing.
I spent $150 on a prom dress and it was the biggest scam ever ..I had to pay $36 to return the dress to the post office in China that shipper never picked it up Alliexpress wouldn’t back me up and said that the shipper never got the item... it’s at the post office for a month and then the Postal Service delivered it back to me in America.. So cheap items ok, otherwise throw money away with no coverage",2019-09-06 13:07:23,takentoclearners
1071,Super cheap,False,5,"I always buy my stuff here because it’s super cheap, but because it’s cheap and from china it takes at least a month for stuff to come in. Either way to re-decorate my whole room I only spent $120 where else I looked on eBay for all the same stuff and it would’ve been over $700. Don’t even get me started on how much it would’ve cost at my local store (half the stuff they wouldn’t even have).

1072,Tiny Money Tons of Love,False,5,"I have had this app for years and I love it. I actually prefer the app to the website because the app has some quicker features in regards to checkout and selecting individual items for purchase. I honestly recommend AliExpress at least 4 or 5 times a week to someone - even strangers, not in a creepy way but more of a nosy/fanatical “I love this app/store” you should too sort of way. I think people really appreciate my enthusiasm and my unsolicited salesmanship.",2018-08-22 04:53:06,BitterSpice_1.0

Had an issue one time when the item was not sent, and the charge was removed quickly. The quality of the items has always been satisfactory.

1074,AliExpress,False,5,So I recently started shopping on AliExpress and I have not had any issues they quickly became my favorite shopping spot. You get better deals and everything arrives on time. If you need help you get it quickly so I just wished I could’ve known about them sooner but I had trust issues. Now I’m happy they are 100% legit and I love everything so many options Best shopping spot hands down.,2022-10-24 22:21:57,DELUXION
1075,Great way to shop in China,False,5,"Fantastic app that communicates well with sellers across seas. Each seller can have their own store, which also provides competitive pricing and tons of products. Definitely research your store before purchasing. Most of issues stem from the shipping logistics and not the product or seller. I highly recommend researching how AliExpress ships ahead of time and setting correct expectations for yourself.",2022-10-23 15:56:45,Ariasti87
1076,Great prices if you search,False,5,"AliExpress has great prices if you take the time to look at the same item from different sellers. I don’t fully understand how the discounts, $ off, codes, etc. work. But, I have been pleased with the quality, price, and shipping speed of the items I’ve purchased (baby bag for stroller and costume shirt). I would be weary of clothing sizes, though.

1077,"By far, my FAVORITE shopping app.",False,5,"I’ve experienced nothing but good. They have products of every imaginable type. Whatever you’re looking for, they likely have a selection from multiple sellers. I’ve found the things I wanted, at decent prices, and the shipping to me was much, much faster than expected. Everything expertly packed too. I’ll be placing more orders for sure. Very happy. They’re my absolute favorite.",2022-08-01 03:54:40,TheTenken
1078,Have fun shopping,False,5,"I’ll warn you in advance, it’s addicting to look at all the products Ali express offers. The prices are amazing and so far everything I’ve ordered has arrived and it has been as good or better than I expected. Way way way too much fun! You have to allow for a little longer shipping than you may be used to, but with such great prices it’s not too much to ask.",2022-03-14 14:07:51,ChazOfNewport
1079,Good,False,3,"I like the app except last week I noticed a change in my order page
I accidentally pushed the button and it said my order was delivered when all I was doing is looking for the tracking of my item I just recently bought.
Now I’m scared that I won’t receive my item. And there is no way to change that I have not received it.
Plus how am I going to rate the seller? If I don’t get the machine or even if I do?
I wish they would help that feature. Plus if I don’t get it how will I get my refund back???",2022-03-20 01:08:28,JESSICA MAX
1080,Very smooth working,False,5,This app is so wonderful. I find Chinese gorgeous adult coloring books and very inexpensive coloring and watercolor supplies much cheaper than Etsy where I would normally purchase these things . Most of my orders were free shipping a couple bucks for others . I understand shipping takes a while so I put my orders back of my mind and it was fun when they started arriving!

1083,+ BUYER BEWARE: Rip off +,False,1,"I bought a pair of shoes from EM-MA Store.  The order was about $75.  They sent me the shoes and when I opened the box, the stink of chemicals knocked me back!  I had to put the shoes in a garbage bag because they smelled so bad.  I was NOT going to put them on my feet.  

I initiated a return and the seller told me that if I paid for the shipping and sent the shoes back, that I would be reimbursed for the shoes.  I paid $44 to ship them back (international) and took a photo of the customs form and receipt.  The seller refused to reimburse me for the rank smelling product and claims that they never got the shoes back. 

I filed a dispute- Ali Express closed it because they said it “timed out.”  I made an appeal and they dropped it for no reason.  I chatted with an agent that said they’d handle it- no further response.  Now I’m getting stone walled and the seller won’t respond to my messages.  

BUYER BEWARE: if you spend any money on this app, you can get screwed like I did!!  DO NOT SHOP AT EM-MA STORE unless you want to smell like a chemical spill.",2021-04-27 18:42:09,LaFlammeNoire
1084,Know your store and trusted Shops!,False,4,"If you do your research before purchasing products and check reviews, images, and seller ratings you are better equipped to receive a suitable parcel. My favorite shops have great communication and respond to my inquiries.

Take your time and read product descriptions and material names to get an honest idea of garment quality and style. Check out size charts and do any conversions if necessary.

Also, always be mindful of return policies before you invest your time and any interest in all items.

Some products are a cheap lower quality version of the depicted garment the image is showing, others will be accurate and well made.

1085,Reliable As any other internet based platform,False,5,"Lots of stuff 
Lots of price to suite your need. You got to know what you want. Do a little research ask questions you will certainly get high quality stuff here. Aliexpress is a very nice platform to buy. It’s be so much better if delivery was little faster. That’s the only draw back, then again it’s coming from soo far away. Highly recommended. Only issue, ordering from USA, is the wait time.... which is natural.",2019-12-17 04:56:08,Thapaman

Seller told me he would reship and then told me he sent another package and gave me a tracking number but then I discovered it was the same exact original tracking number. When I look up the tracking number, it reads it has been delivered but I never got my order. I’m sure it went back to seller and now I’m without money and without my order. I’m requesting refund from the seller but I’m also trying to get in tough with some one from AliExpress and I’m unable to reach some one to help me",2020-04-04 07:48:30,Ronnierdz5475

You just have to be careful what you buy and who u buy it from. Those choices are all on the consumer, so I wouldn’t blame the website if I got anything bad. U pay for what u get, right.

1090,Bad everything,False,1,"I love this app. When it decides to work. I recently redownloaded it because I switched phones and it didn’t get transferred. The app even gave me a free coupon to use on my order! The coupon then caused my order to be canceled after payment, which I wasn’t even aware of until about 10 days later. I did not receive a reason for why my order was canceled and I have still not received a refund. When I contacted customer service, I never got the chance to speak to a human, it was just automated responses that were completely unrelated to the problems I was trying to tell them about. Super disappointed because I never had this problem in the past.",2019-04-15 03:48:40,FaveFallenOne
1091,HORRIBLE,False,1,"Don’t expect to get your money back if your sold a defective product. It’s a joke. I had to explain myself to the seller multiple times and send multiple pictures and videos in both the dispute and to the seller and STILL haven’t received my money back or ever a response after they said they would review the video. So either they’re waiting for me to give up or for the time to get a refund to expire. It’s a SCAM. And it’s over a speaker that cost $10, but the speaker was comply blown and the buttons don’t work!! I’m so confused of why they have good reviews. Obviously those people have never returned anything

If you’re patient, the average shipping won’t bother you. The only bad thing I can say is I just got the most recent update and the image search isn’t working and that makes the app more efficient. Please fix soon.",2018-12-05 13:01:40,DreceShavon

In the U.S, shipping is free which makes the products very cheap and great material!! I really recommend this app if you like things from all over the place, because they have American things, Japanese things, Korean things, and more! The problem is, I’ve heard their return system isn’t the greatest. However, I’ve never tried to return anything so I can’t say if this is true. I 9/10 completely recommend!",2018-04-07 00:15:09,Kogane_77
1095,Ridiculous,False,1,"I can’t even fully review this app, because I downloaded it and attempted to create an account, then was promptly directed to a page saying sorry something went wrong, please use another device to login. I thought perhaps it was just a small bug, so I went to my email where I clicked the link to verify the email address. After verifying it successfully, I returned to the app and attempted to login, This time it directed me to login using a computer. It’s not a good look when right out of the gate, you are directed to not, in fact, use the app to login but rather an entirely different device. Thankfully, I have access to a computer, but many people only have their phones.",2018-02-17 00:33:50,AlexathePerson
1096,Great stuff at great prices,False,5,"I’ve been very happy with my purchases. Also, the app is very user friendly. I mostly order kitchen gadgets and knives. I’m so impressed by the items I’ve received. The only caveat is the shipping time. While a few items have been shipped rather quickly, the majority of the items take 6-8 weeks to arrive. That’s ok, just keep that in mind if ordering gifts or for special occasions.",2022-10-09 19:21:21,SanDiegoChick

Finding something with AliExpress for $3 that I had previously spend $20 on - through a competitors website/app - was eye opening to say the least.

1099,Multiple issues,False,3,"The variety of products is excellent. Descriptions are good but often should contain more details. Lack of details prevent me from buying. 

Cycling clothing kits should allow me to buy different size jersey and shorts.  This prevents me from buying some kits. 

When buying socks, the photo includes many socks but the price is for one sock pair.  This is misleading. 

When selecting socks, I should be able to buy several different colors and different quantities of different colors. This does not work on your site. This prevents me from buying more socks. 

You charged me for a delivery I did not receive. I have camera proof that nothing was delivered to my front door.  And, I get an email every day with photos of each item the US Postal Service delivers to me. All this is proof the item was never delivered yet you denies my claim.

However I’m male causation…why in the world is product after product of black female wigs and such on my pages?!!!! I have NEVER looked up such products and I’m not even of that race.

1102,LOVE the IMAGE SEARCH FEATURE!!!,False,5,I love this app! Every time I find something online that I like - I can search for it on Aliexpress and I always find it for a lot less money! I always search for items from social media ads - it blows me away how much things are marked up. Example: a pair of earrings that received a lot of orders through a social media ad were listed for $10 - I found them for .68 cents and free shipping.,2022-01-10 15:47:50,Lookformiracles
1103,Good shopping - terrible UI,False,4,"It’s not extremely difficult to shop using this app and the associated web site.
Pros:
Lowest prices on some items if you can wait for shipping. And are willing to search and search.
Some items aren’t available elsewhere.
Cons:
Trying to identify lowest price is impossible. First, there is no search by lowest price + shipping.
Options are listed as “colors”.
Items are listed as groups of different related products. So if you’re ordering a radio, the price might appear as a $5, but that’s for the antenna, the radio is $50. Meanwhile, the same radio is $20 in another listing, but since the antenna came up first, you’d never find it if you look at prices. It’s almost useless.

I’d give it 1 star for all the time I’ve wasted, but I’ve gotten good deals, by digging and digging.",2022-01-28 23:33:33,Hoboken Dave

Go out of their way to
Make  sure that all ur questions are answered . Like anything else lo, I take the bad with the good and i do think
That there  a more good than bad. Some of the sellers just need to be more open and honest with the customers and are more likely to get a return customer . Thsnk you for  letting me share my opinion with you

I wish Ali would give the options to ""sort"" or ""view recently added"" or ""category"" such as ""women's clothing"" or ""home decor""! The way it is... If you have too many ""likes"" it becomes a bit difficult and chances are you won't ever go back to check out or purchase those earlier discoveries (because it's nearly impossible to find what you're looking for !) 
Aside from that I'm pretty much happy !

1110,Love!,False,5,Always helps me find the best price for items! Shipping can take longer sometimes but this doesn’t bother me. Shipping has actually been faster than usual. Sellers are pretty good with communication and the website always makes sure you get your items or a refund if they don’t arrive! Out of the many orders I have placed only a single pack of stickers never made it. Site allowed me to dispute the order and gave me back my money.,2020-12-04 04:26:19,CayleedRam
1111,Straight from the source shopping,False,5,"I find this app addicting. Cheap items, cheap shipping you can’t go wrong. Been ordering from AliExpress since 2012. Some tips would be to always read reviews, check the amount of orders, be patient with shipping, and if there’s any issues dispute it right away thru the app. Never really had any issues with refunds. Would recommend if you enjoy shopping and having everyday feel like Christmas! ☺️",2020-11-28 22:47:12,J. Yerr
1112,Wholesale Vendors at your Service,False,5,"A variety of vendors in one app! I was hesitant to use AliExpress at first but after my few orders I am committed to repurchasing my favorite items here. You can pick and choose your own vendor and research what best suits your needs. I personally found a vendor who is very responsive and cares about their customers. I recommend to anyone who is trying to start their first business, there are a variety of items you can choose from.",2020-04-11 16:47:44,daddyjast
1113,Needs a better search function,False,4,"This app is awesome. It brings so many companies together in a convenient spot so that we customers can have many choices.
It’s only downfall, and I suspect it might be translation based, is that searching for certain items can be difficult.   I have typed the name of an item and received no results & yet later found that exact item with that exact name while searching for something else.
Other than that, I really like this app a lot.",2020-07-25 07:40:46,Mandrake10.0
1114,Don’t use this app,False,1,"Ali always stand with seller, not buyers.
I bought a noodle machine at price 195usd, however the item came with two damaged areas. Their dispute team made decision for me, which is refund me 30% of total cost and let me keep the item. I definitely don’t want to keep, and the customer service kicked me out after switching five agents and saying the item is still holding certain value, if I want to return the item go ask seller. Why not making decision return the item, bc seller probably will lose 50 bucks on shipping due to this item ship from China. Ali customer service is not servicing customer.
Do not use this app!",2020-06-22 20:23:33,MUSA0710
1115,Fantastic app for purchasing items on the cheap,False,5,"If you don’t mind waiting a month or sometimes less then AliExpress is your guy! 
I collect LEGO minifigures but I don’t like spending $12+ for a little plastic minifig.. I’ve order basically all of the Star Wars minifigures that I’m missing from Vendors on AliExpress for less than a $1.00 a piece.. The overall quality of the replica minifigures on AliExpress are just about the same as the real deal LEGO but without the outlandish prices on eBay...",2020-02-22 02:48:14,I banged ur sister
1116,LOVE ALIEXPRESS,False,5,"I have used AliExpress for YEARS and definitely for YEARS to come! It is the most diverse and heavily stocked website I’ve ever seen ranging from clothing for all ages, wedding dresses, kitchen gadgets, essential oils, exotic seeds, decals, quality name brand lookalikes,  to customized jewelry. In summary....YOU NAME IT they have it! It’s like all of the major retailers bundled into one awesome app and virtually everything is SO inexpensive especially when compared to American retail prices so I’m perfectly okay with waiting a little longer for shipping!!!",2020-01-13 14:39:53,Godgirl6
1117,Excellent quality,False,5,"I order these to sell in the local market.... Ordered before from another supplier product sold but out of 10 pieces 2 were not working lost money on them.
These are well packaged and better than the other supplier, better voice quality, inexpensive for my pocket and overall a satisfied product. I ordered 20 pieces for trial haven't sold any but confident enough they will get me a good profit and a satisfied customer base.
Thank you

1118,Love this app,False,5,"Ali Express is the original Amzn. So many wonderful things all in one place. Just be prepared to wait sometimes. I’m in the U.S. and ma y items ship from overseas and that takes time. If they give you a date, be prepared to wait a couple of weeks longer than the promised date.  But the items are good quality! Just remember you get what you pay for so super cheap might be super cheap.",2022-11-03 02:22:35,KB1549
1119,Wish some feature were available.,False,4,"The app is pretty good but it lacks some of the features available online (on the computer). Like dispute handling. Order cancelling etc. Or at least I have not figured out how to do it. Also, the app turns off the volume off when I am listening to audio books and try to shop at the same time. Extremely annoying not to be able to do both.",2022-10-21 20:51:51,flowerlily1
1120,Their alright,False,5,Sometimes they send stuff that’s not like the description very cheap on the clothes material but big on the shoes smaller on the jewelry . There not Great how they use getting more expensive. Soon people may stop buying how their going. Also gotta ship stuff back and wait like a month or more sometimes for stuff only for it not to fit but overall sometimes it’s good stuff.,2022-10-06 05:10:18,@nonymous buyer
1121,Love this app,False,5,"I love this app; sometimes, you have time to order here instead of on famous websites like the bay.  Ali express will give you the ability to save some cash and get more products, shipping can be slow, but they have fantastic customer service, so there are no issues with items not being delivered, money back warranty is excellent, and they listen to both the buyer and seller.",2022-06-18 18:36:38,danu :-)
1122,I really wanted to like this site,False,3,Bought several items from different stores. Found they seem to stuff the items in a to small box it bag and items come smashed. Jewelry I bought came with scratches. Since from china to hard to return. Think I will stay within the USA to order. Then at least it’s easy to return if not satisfied.  I was hoping it would be a place to get items at a lower cost. But the flaws and taking so long to receive just isn’t worth the hassle.,2022-07-24 13:19:09,Pertouch
1123,AliExpress definitely has what you need.,False,5,"I searched every site I knew of to find all category of items and could not find them at reasonable prices. Just by chance I checked AliExpress and to my surprise, they have a slew of items I have been looking for and for a fraction of the advertised price of other sites. Shipping takes a little long but, the price was well worth the wait.",2021-09-25 01:45:19,piroco66

1125,Great and Useful,False,5,"All my needs are met with this App. I can order anything I can possibly imagine. Shipping often takes long but it’s only logical that packages from overseas take long, but I am a patient person so this don’t not faze me. It is a legitimate market, I can buy eyelashes, phone cases, wigs and bundles just about anything! Prices are great, as well as quality, and I think that’s what we’re mostly concerned about.",2021-08-30 22:24:58,EB.01
1126,Love this app,False,5,This app has a lot of options and choices to choose from. The prices are really good and you can expect to have your product fairly quickly. So far I have had no issues with this app and I continue to purchase from it every so often. I would recommend this app if you want to buy gifts or alot of things at one time since the prices are good.,2021-07-25 01:52:41,Ilymuches<3
1127,Fun Retail Therapy! <3,False,5,"I love using this app to treat myself when I need a little retail therapy. Everything is cute, fun, or interesting to look at. I have also ordered a few things so far and they have all been great. I also like how it keeps items in your cart but you can choose which items you actually want to check out. The coupons are attached to items as well. Overall it’s a fun app :)",2021-02-05 20:27:52,SugarSyringe
1128,Terrible!,False,1,"A complete waste of your money and time! I have had nothing but bad experience with them. Either they send the wrong product or the quality of the product is very low. The prices might be low, but it’s not worth the crap you receive. If you receive it. I have had orders that never came (apparently because the post office didn’t notify me correctly) and they have terrible customer service and don’t resolve your problem. You are left with your money payed and nothing received. They should learn from their competitors how to properly deal with customers. Would recommend Joom over AliExpress anytime!",2021-06-14 11:35:26,nsnfnficmffbtbehdbfjfkkd
1129,Worst app ever,False,1,You never get the customer support that you need. On the app is very limited on the comments when there’s an issue with your order. When you use the wrong one or it cannot be classified they will not respond. For example I had an issue with the item stating it was never sent but the supplier was able to give a tracking number they asked me to go find our local post office in the United States there’s no option of just going to any local post office and asked if there was that item. As for the app it advised since they give you a tracking number it’s our issue. So don’t ever use this app,2021-03-16 15:15:59,clara0424
1130,My purchasing experience with AliExpress,False,5,Initially I was very hesitant in ordering from AliExpress but they had several items listed that I couldn’t find elsewhere.  I took a chance and am very happy with my overall experience.  I have since made several other purchases and this app has made it really easy to communicate with and buy from all of the different companies listed here.,2021-01-31 13:57:31,Mahalo&Aloha
1131,Love it! Just look at reviews and you’ll get what you pay for!,False,5,"I’ve been using AliExpress for a very long time now, a little over a year I would say. I’m very happy with what I have ordered. My tips are to buy from bigger companies to ensure it’s not a scam. Or just make sure the item has good, enough, and recent reviews. It’s very cheap and the items are usually good quality. I would recommend 100%",2020-12-22 23:50:05,vesmee
1132,"Great App, fast, and easy to navigate",False,5,"I have nothing but great things to say about the app. For the 40-50 purchases I’ve done I have had nothing but amazingly results. Even when I had an issue with a product it was handled extremely fast and fair. 
     Just like everything else online make sure to read the reviews for those companies you’re buying from, and enjoy.",2020-12-11 13:59:29,Brazilwill
1133,Good shopping app tbh!,False,5,"I was skeptical on using this because people said it took a month or two for them to get their products, but from my experiences the sellers always ship my things the week I bought my items. Then takes 2 weeks to get to me. Just understand that there is a U.S. Custom that these products needs to go to first. Over all the products I’ve received so far are true to the pictures and descriptions!",2020-09-12 05:26:50,NINJASDUDE98
1134,Good Product more for wholesales though,False,4,"AliExpress has more than enough to choose from like phones cases to house funiture clothing anything you name they have it for a cheaper price. Although, it may take 3-6 weeks to get you depending on what you buy expedited shipping is very high but not worth it because it won’t be the next day. Overall it’s a great app that saves you money! I will continue to shop here because of you don’t recieve and item you get your money back and there return policy is very generous!",2020-09-20 18:21:14,Trvll.Chick
1135,Top Performer,False,4,The best app as far as overseas discounted shopping goes. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is because some of the stuff is difficult to figure out and difficult to get an answer on. Also they have special offers and freebies that I’m not even sure they actually produce on being that I have applied for the max of two every day since I have been on the app in March and haven’t won not one item yet. So I’m very skeptical. Other than those things mentioned it A1 best thing out.,2020-09-04 06:19:26,SwaggerSavage
1136,Covid Delays,False,3,"If I was asked this before March, AliExpress would’ve had a 5-star rating. I use AliExpress a lot, but ever since the Corona Pandemic, all my packages take forever to come in. No matter where it is, it’s like it’s been lost in shipping. I have two pair of lashes I ordered separate of 2020, and AliExpress says my order-tracking is complete but I haven’t received my order yet. I opened a dispute for a refund a couple weeks ago, and it’s still “being reviewed”. My wig glue also hasn’t came in yet, also ordered beginning of March. Two pairs of sandals haven’t came neither, ordered beginning of April.",2020-06-10 18:54:22,Dreebandz

I was told first was going to come sometime In June, June came and went then got a notice that my order would come sometime in early/mid July, still got nothing but another message saying that my package would come now in august. That’s  ridiculous, this place needs to pull their heads out and get there act together. Tried to put in a request for my money back  and was asked to give them 10 days to get my stuff, did that and still nothing. When I tried to fill out there forms for a request when I would go to hit submit form always got an error message.  WILL NEVER BUY FROM AGAIN",2020-07-28 18:44:12,gonzn054
1138,TRASH,False,1,"It is IMPOSSIBLE to get in contact with anyone at this company. I ordered a product, and the seller messaged me(keep in mind they can barely speak English), asking me to cancel the order because they can’t ship it to me. I asked them why they can’t cancel or decline it, why did they accept the order in the first place? They ignored the question and keep asking me to cancel the order. Here’s the problem: every time I cancel the order, it uncancels itself. I suspect the seller is doing this because they don’t want anyone to know they cannot ship to my location. I’m trying to get in contact with someone so I can get my refund, but THERE IS NO WAY TO REACH A HUMAN BEING.",2020-06-24 22:11:06,hbelena
1139,Some unprofessional employees and sellers take your money,False,1,Had an issue with an item and the employee basically called me a liar even with the pictures I sent. Then I tried to ask about the seller that asked me to pay more money or cancel my items (they said shipping prices went up but the prices of these items never changed which seemed fishy to me). I canceled the items and now I can’t get the seller to refund my money or respond back to me and the employee wouldn’t answer my emails. There are still some great people on there that sell but the ones that just take your money make you not want to do business with them at all for fear of it happening again.,2020-05-30 07:49:52,Done with AliExpress

1141,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly",False,3,"AliExpress is a good portal tu use when shopping for assisted flipper pocket EDC knives.
There are too many duplicate coming from a good number of “Originators/Manufacturers. 
Prices are always within pennies of each other.
The TRACKING after a purchase is pretty much worthless. For example, I received a low dollar OTF knife which TRACKING says is not yet possible to track yet and will be delivered between Sept. 10th and 29th.  BAM ! It came today August 13th.
They do play games with descriptions, particularly automatic knives ! My “No Name” knife from today’s arrival is a handful of automatic with the double sided dagger FLYING out and retracting with major force !
I suspected it was OTF automatic from the pictures but NOT from the description.
Under $20 delivered, so I’m more than satisfied and just ordered 3 more for gifts.
Search around diligently, order an inexpensive Kershaw and make your own mind up about ordering Chinese steel and MANY top brands !",2019-08-20 02:42:09,Rickosan#47

Recently, I bought earrings and it has been a month and a half the product never reached me. I have tried to contact seller but they have removed themselves from the app as well :/ so that was a scam. Be careful and check who your buying from make sure there are more than one or two reviews about the buyer.

And this time I was notified of a delivery, that never came. Because “every purchase has buyers protection” I wasn’t worried. Unfortunately after weeks disputing and rejecting proposals that were designed to make me wait until almost the last minute, all the evidence I provided about the dispute with the shipping company, and my files lost package search was “inseficient”! I now sit here having paid $70 for 2 products I never recieved!! I will delete this app, and will never order from them again!!! Bogus! They will steal your money!",2018-05-30 13:47:01,darkwind80
1147,Love it,False,5,I'm new to AliExpress. So far I am very happy with what I have ordered. I receive my orders faster than expected. They looked just how they were advertised. I was very surprised of how well their quality was. Was afraid before they arrived they might look very cheap but they didn't they are really nice and for such a cheap price. I have placed several more items since I know how good the quality of merchandise is.,2022-09-14 09:34:16,craftster61
1148,Only two things need improvement,False,5,"Overall a really FANTASTIC and hassle free app. Only two things need improvement:- 1- videos take way too long to download and play. 2- the search engine is not as powerful as google. Unless you get a name or description pretty close, you may not find the product you are looking for. Otherwise it’s one of the best apps out there !",2022-08-19 10:39:44,MAQQAM

1150,I LOVE ALIEXPRESS,False,5,AliExpress where have you been all my life I'm glad I found it! The prices are so affordable it can buy stuff for like 30 cents :D most of the products aliExpress are from China but don't worry sometimes the things you buy come really early but mostly it takes like two months or three I mean cmon china is like on the other side of the world so it's gonna take some time but the wait is worth it trust me I LOVE ALIEXPRESS <3,2022-08-15 23:55:43,DudeShesCute
1151,Very helpful!,False,5,AliExpress is definitely the place to go for almost anything you may want to find! Yes it may take some time for various things to get to your place of residence but as a customer for several months I can say that it’s worth it at the end. From clothing and shoes to figures from your favorite anime and movies to various electronics and so much more AliExpress is great if you know where to look! 😫😫😫😫,2022-07-23 22:44:20,TTx2😾
1152,Read item descriptions carefully,False,5,If you read the item descriptions carefully (don’t just go off of or assume based on the photo) and order from stores with multiple good ratings you will find some great deals. It takes a long time for you to receive your item (like 2-4 weeks) but as long as you are patient and pay attention they have great stuff.,2022-05-28 07:06:47,waitin2get$$
1153,Far better than similar sites!,False,5,"I have and continue to purchase from several different sites very similar to AliExpress.
I’ve found the items on AliExpress are generally less costly (for completely identical products). Shipping is substantially less expensive than other sites. The selection is larger than other sites. The items generally arrive more quickly than with other sites.
Regarding the “Big Box” sites:
Unless I’m needing a product within a few days, I have started checking AliExpress before purchasing from the “big box” sites.
I have found some of the products here are substantially less expensive including the shipping charges.
Overall, this is a site I highly recommend!",2022-04-28 15:05:22,deb16502
1154,Easy to give your money but not easy to get it back,False,3,"I have found that it’s never a hassle to pay for items, but in the event that you file a dispute to get issued a refund, it’s always a headache. Sometimes the package will say delivered when in fact is was never delivered and so they won’t issue you a refund. And if you are granted a refund, a lot of the time, you will not be refunded the full amount you pay. I honestly think these are the main reasons why people are hesitant to shop on Ali Express.",2022-05-26 03:15:37,jordiraemac
1155,Great products,False,5,I have used AliExpress for many years now and I’ve been pleased with the service and the products they offer for a way lower price than retail. If you don’t mind the longer shipping involved and don’t need it immediately it’s worth the wait. The sellers for the most part are eager to make you’re shopping experience with them as pleasant as possible. Thank You AliExpress,2022-03-16 20:08:08,Dazey2468

It makes me feel like customers are not important to the sellers and I’m nervous about making big purchases.",2022-02-18 03:50:25,Gurlcat
1158,Terrible experience with seller,False,1,"The app is fine but if you buy anything and the seller doesn’t ship in 7 days it takes 20 business days to get a refund. That’s is unacceptable and unprofessional. You should not allow sellers on your app that do this. I order the product and it didn’t ship so I had to wait a month to get my money back, then I reordered and seller didn’t post tracking number in 7 days again so now I have to wait another month to get a refund? This is ridiculous. You can process my refund in one day if you wanted to. But you choose to float my money a month. This is unethical and wrong.",2022-01-04 19:52:34,madmax7871

1162,Much better than wish.,False,5,"CRAZY cheap prices, good quality. Slow shipping but, again, crazy cheap. If it gets lost in the mail it’s not their fault but they’ll still reimburse you. I haven’t had anything lost. I’ve bought a ton of stationary,  stickers, craft supplies from here. Some really fantastic stuff I haven’t seen anywhere else. I use it for packaging jewelry I sell and my buyers adore the extra touch while I get to play with cute stuff. Win win.",2020-10-10 18:24:03,Mycommenter

At least a month till you get your items and sometimes 2-3 months. They send items that have nothing to do with the pictures they present and if it look close to what they show you the fabric is super cheap there is threads coming out of the clothes. Tag sew on the shoulder and you have no one to talk to, all you have to do is trash what you bought. Even to give it as donation it’s a shame. Save your money and stay away from this app.",2021-03-12 06:23:48,shoshos787879
1164,Easy to use,False,4,Very good site. I browse most every day.  Great selections at great prices.  Just have problems finding some items.  I get a different selection of items when I am logged in as opposed to not.  My husband even gets a different selection from either of my searches. I was able to find items on his computer but not on mine while logged in or not logged in and while using the same name search. Confusing.,2021-02-14 00:16:44,Atineg
1165,No Live Person to Help with Disputes,False,1,"Everything’s good when it’s going good. The moment you have a problem & want to dispute or Return for Refund, that’s where the problems begin. There is no phone number or customer service department. You have an email system with prompts. It’s very very hard processing a Return. If your willing to Risk not receiving your purchase & lose money, then yes if you find a good deal, then go for it. But if the price is not a bargain, pass on your purchase, because you have to wait about a month to receive Order, and you might get wrong Order. If you get wrong Order. It’s a pain to process Return. They don’t care about the customers at all.",2020-11-11 22:22:19,Fun 2 won
1166,EVERYONE NEEDS THIS APP,False,5,"honestly I can’t find a bad thing to say about AliExpress, it’s such a convenient app when I want to save money, there’s the exception where your products will often take a while to get there, and that’s not an understatement, be ready to wait months for your product, I personally don’t mind it. Also make sure anything you wanna buy ALREADY has reviews and pictures of the product so you can be assured it’s accurate !",2020-10-04 01:22:12,TitaaaBonitaaaa
1167,Great Shopping Experience,False,5,I’ve been using this app for quite a while now. I was a bit skeptical at first since everything was super inexpensive and had low shipping costs. I’ve gotten AirPod cases for a crazy low price and I have not been disappointed with anything regarding shipping and price. Would definitely recommend this platform if you don’t mind waiting around a month of shipping. I have nothing but time so it doesn’t bother me.,2020-05-15 22:22:02,Karen Purewal
1168,Shipping nightmare,False,1,"Ordered items in May 2020 and the seller gave approximate dates of delivery.  They estimated late May to the second week of June.  This 30 day gap seemed acceptable considering everything going on globally.  
It actually showed a date, if the items haven’t arrived by June 14th, that I could open a dispute.  Well as soon as that day came near they changed it to July 21st now and no option for dispute until then. I tried multiple times to reach the seller or find alternate ways to cancel or refund my order to no avail.  
Now that I’ve changed addresses, due to circumstances beyond my control, they are citing delivery failure.
Never buying from Ali Express or HoliterHome Store again.
Buyer beware!",2020-07-22 18:59:23,Brian_VP
1169,Good app,False,4,"This app is great. But I feel like the prices are getting close to eBay which has more reputation than this one. Some things are cheaper than eBay  Some seller ship fast others take their sweet time but everything gets here eventually. Sooo before you buy here check the other site first. Shipping and prices are better. I still love this app tho.
Note: reason why I took one star is because some sellers take forever to ship and prices are comparable to those in eBay. But you sooo get your stuff.",2020-07-17 01:32:29,makeupbev
1170,Yet to receive my order from Ali express.,False,2,Please something needs to be done about customers not receiving their items or goods on time or the said date and time it ought to have gotten to us. If possible have an outlet well known to customers all over the various countries involved. Also get quality representatives that can carry the names or front the company very well. Today is Sunday the 28th of June am yet to receive my wireless AirPodding I ordered. The name and numbers of the dispatched companies should also be included when sending information to customers for a more better and quality services.,2020-06-28 10:06:13,IFY de BEST
1171,I love the app but there are some thing I hate about it.,False,3,I love the products that I can get off of AliExpress and all but I hate that I can’t talk to an actual person whenever I have a problem so it really makes this app not worth it at all. I also hate that I get hipped out of money when my items don’t arrive because the sellers always say that oh it sent so just be patient months later and it still hasn’t arrived and I have lost money that I can’t get back. I also can’t even get to my wishlist at all. This app really needs to be fixed.,2020-06-15 03:12:07,jeneosbdnkdl
1172,Wish Lists,False,3,"AliExpress is my top favorite app to order from. I️ love the amazing low prices, but the only thing is, I️ can’t open my wish lists. I️ haven’t been able to get into my wish lists since June 9th and today is now June 12th . I️ really would appreciate if that was fixed . Also, more lists . I️ would love to be able to have more than 10 wish lists, I️ think I️t should be unlimited wish lists that we can have , along with the shopping cart . My cart only lets me have 100 items at a time , I️ think that should be unlimited also .",2020-06-13 04:49:28,Shawtycute10
1173,Love it.,False,5,Haven’t had any issues ordering. Once I get a product in the mail I open it verify it’s correct/working then I confirm good received. Otherwise I open a case and AliExpress handles everything. I’ve gotten refunds for receiving an incorrect item and a seller being weird about shipping. Just take screen shots and utilize the open dispute. I switched to this app after wish shadowbanned me from using them and I’m so glad because I prefer it.,2020-04-07 07:05:42,lotsofangrybees
1174,Simply Marvelous!!,False,5,"I just love this app and the stores with in it. At first I was skeptical shopping online, but I gave it a try. Ever since I been hooked I been an active shopper for 8yrs+ what makes it great for me I can get almost everything I can possibly need/want.

1175,Love the deals,False,5,"I love it how the price is a lot less and I can actually afford it. I do wish the sizes would also show in inches, because I have been disappointed before since I thought the die was larger. But overall I really like to shop here. Only had twice where I ran into a problem. But I bought hundreds of products on here. I can sometimes find a paper craft product that I can’t find in any of the stores. So, I love it!",2019-09-09 14:56:42,bubaka7

The shipping was fast, literally I received my unit 3 days after I purchased the wig. I’m extremely happy about that. The hair is absolutely beautiful. It had no odors or no smells, the hair is extremely soft. It has ton of Luster/shine full of volume in its natural state. I’m highly pleased with my purchase and I will definitely order more from Lumiere Hair. Thanks",2019-04-11 00:33:51,Tasha3130
1178,Terrific,False,5,"I’ve been shopping with Aliexpress for a couple years now, and I really enjoy it. The app works perfectly. Very easy to shop and checkout, as well as send and receive messages to and from individual vendors. Shipping does take some time, as to be expected, so be prepared to wait. Any issues I’ve personally had with my orders have been quickly addressed and resolved. I definitely recommend giving Aliexpress a try. Very fun shopping.",2019-03-05 16:56:41,JJJSFCD
1179,Superhero Capes,False,5,"Absolutely perfect for a toddlers birthday party! This is my second time ordering capes from here and the SHIPPING was SUPER FAST! Within a week (I even selected the free shipping option)!!! I was super surprised and very happy! 

Make sure though, when ordering you pay attention to size. The Small is almost, and I say “almost” because they will work fine for my little 5 year old’s party, but if it were a 6 year old’s Birthday, you’d want to get the biggest size.",2019-01-29 14:03:09,Ellewoodsm
1180,Excellent App (Do research on the products),False,5,"This app is great for small ticket items that you want for a good deal, the quality of everything I’ve received has been better than the items I have purchased from Wish and the customer service is way better. My only advise it search for reviews of the products you are interested to make sure it’s actually as the seller describes. I have yet to have a bad experience.",2018-01-18 23:57:54,Rusty Longsword
1181,Fast and easy,False,4,Love the convenience of AE but would like to have a little more control after the purchase is made. I have received everything I have ever ordered from them. The problem is some I get in 2 weeks and some I get in two months. The tracking information is horrible and is never current. I just received a package 12-13 that I was told by the shipping company wouldn’t arrive until 1-15. We should be able to have it narrowed down to the correct week at minimum.,2018-12-13 21:44:52,TeoIII
1182,Good buying app,False,4,I really like this app has low prices on neat stuff and has a section for brand items incase you want quality items. Shipping is faster than wish only took me a week to receive some LED’s compared to wish where i bought some headphones and came a month later. But aliexpress stopped allowing purchases to be paid by paypal which is the only way i paid so i cant buy anymore stuff. Hopefully they change that so i canbe able to buy things with paypal again.,2018-05-10 04:05:05,ZKkill3r
1183,"Great app, if your willing to wait a bit",False,5,"I’ve had shipments come in as soon as two weeks, others take a couple months so remain patient and you will receive your package.

Not just for “fake” stuff, has quality gear.",2022-11-22 02:07:02,cdsjshsdhvejf
1184,All the world here,False,5,Easy and safe website. But you have to select quality salers as some of them. Showing pictures looks great but the quality for the fabric is very cheap so make sure to discuss with the seller what is the return policy and ask them to send a coupon or anything to facilitate the return process before buying in case they providing Fadwa quality material,2022-11-03 21:31:09,sarah us
1185,Speedy Delivery,False,5,"i purchase the robes on a Saturday and receive it on the following Friday. Speedy Delivery. Great Quality. But the only thing is I purchase 3 different sizes (x-large, XX large, & XXXLarge). I using them as my bridesmaid robes and they all fit the same. So one size fits all BUT over all great quality and purchase. I went up 2 sizes to ensure they will fit, but you can see how they fit on me- overall i am so impressed with these robes.",2022-10-30 05:23:19,Preciouskay

Love your site and all it has to offer. Mike",2022-08-18 07:52:09,Penny2manz
1187,Handy app,False,4,"It definitely takes 2+ weeks for items to be delivered but it’s really worth the low prices. I mostly purchase stickers, stationary, jewelry, and small items. I haven’t tried things like toys and larger items. I was skeptical at first but I’ve been satisfied soo far for the most part. I had one item that never came. It was a gift for a friend. Also a dress that was really pretty but the threading almost took the whole dress out.",2022-10-07 21:32:18,cheechlalobski
1188,Reliable app,False,5,"I’ve been using the app for years now and it never disappoints. Easy to navigate, lots of choices, quality products at a reasonable price.

They are also good with dispute if you received an item that is not of quality or the order didn’t arrive.",2022-07-08 11:37:11,sprinkles380
1189,AliExpress,False,5,Love it although some sellers aren’t as good and always make sure you look at the reviews but besides that everything is great and you can find so many affordable stuff and you can earn coins from when you buy items and the coins turn into money or coupons on certain items which is a wide variety that are rlly helpful too,2022-03-31 03:10:11,bbl_bumday

If he put correct address they would have know and will be able to find my address and send to me, but the seller sent to the wrong address so the in Springfield can’t find or send me mt package?

never have any issues - sellers are mostly all responsive and the two times something was lost I got replacements! I recommend this app to everyone. Shipping is generally 3-6 weeks. (It’s usually stuck at my country’s arrival destination)",2022-02-08 20:13:11,amandaamandazhzhzh
1193,I was skeptical too...,False,5,Many purchases later & very pleased. If you can be patient w/ the shipping process you’ll be happy w/ your purchase. In my experience the shipping has been prompt so I’ve been lucky. I don’t think there’s anything you can’t find here. It’s mind blowing to me anyway. I will continue to shop here for all kinds of reasons. My daughter is actually who turned me on to the site.,2021-04-12 02:13:45,AlainaP13
1194,Great app,False,4,"I love this app. I mainly buy things for dropship in the United States. My only complaint is that all the items take tooooooo long to get to the customers. And your shipping rates provide good margins for any profit. I would like to know where the AliExpress warehouse is here in the United States? We could get a lot more business done. 

Overall, AliExpress has these games where you can grow fruit, water it, and catch worms to get ‘Coins’ which take money off of your orders. Pretty cool",2022-02-02 21:13:54,Stacky LaCheese

1198,I love it but you gotta be careful,False,4,"AllieExpress is amazing for get a big variety things, the thing I recommend is being careful when you order, sometimes the pictures are only to get you’re attention, you MUST READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT! Also, you have to be realistic about the things you buy, you can’t expect a long lasting beautiful necklace if you’re only paying $3 for it. Just keep in mind that you’re getting what you’re paying for.",2021-03-26 23:25:09,THIS IS A NICKNAME UGH
1199,FRAUD,False,1,"Never had a problem with them up until now. 
There was money taken out of my account twice, 50+ dollars both times & I obviously did NOT approve of them. I did not save my card info so I’m guessing it was from one of the two sellers I purchased from. Also, if I try logging in from elsewhere, it won’t let me log in because it somehow decided to make up an email of its own & it does NOT let me change it from my mobile app. I tried multiple times deleted my account & it won’t let me. Be wise when purchasing anything from here, I would highly suggest avoiding this app at all costs!!!!",2021-02-27 09:58:47,acosta.st
1200,Love AliExpress,False,5,"Such a variety. The only downfalls are how slow the shipping takes! And also, I like to search with the “free shipping” box checked, cus if you don’t, the shipping is always pretty expensive. So if you are shipping smart by items, you end up not shopping smart at all cus the shipping just gets you for a ridiculous amount of money! 
I think they should offer free shipping on everything!",2021-02-20 17:14:01,kweennicolee
1201,Better then I expected,False,5,I was skeptic to use this app bc everything is so affordable but so far everything I’ve ordered has arrive and is so cash friendly for my pockets while still letting me do all the fashion pieces I want. Haven’t gotten anything aside from clothes from the site but I’m very pleased. 👊🏼👊🏼 10/10 great for bawling on a budget. You do have to be patient with the shipping BUT it’s super easy to let them know you haven’t received a package.,2020-03-12 13:24:39,pandreamunoz
1202,So many things!,False,4,"It’s so fun to browse on this app. So many things! I wish search terms were better interpreted. Many, if not most, search results are oddly off. Also, while on a listing, “recommended” usually pulls up all the same stuff from prior searches, and not items similar to the listing you’re currently viewing. 

Overall the app is fun and products are inexpensive. 

I love that reviews include customer photos—my favorite part of AliExpress!",2021-01-23 20:55:20,Dafratucker
1203,Canceled my account,False,1,"AliExpress has gone downhill lately and I canceled my account and this app. I didn’t receive a combined shipment of items and one of the sellers refused to refund me even though all the others did and tracking showed the item never arrived in the US. AliExpress kept telling me to wait longer. I waited so long, asking and disputing the whole time, that they auto completed the order because it had been 3 months. The seller kept lying and then just ignored me. I’ve always had good experiences with the hundreds of things I’ve bought over the years but  this made me very leery of ever using them again. So I’m done.",2021-01-18 19:58:54,the_hunger_games_book
1204,Quite nice 👍,False,3,"The only problem I have is the tracking for what you purchased because you’re not guaranteed that it’ll arrive to you. Also every seller is different. They may or may not refund you if your purchase does not arrive and you miss out. I have had an order of 3 items from a seller and I only received one of the products. Luckily the seller was willing to resend the products and I have yet to receive them. Other than that, I have had a nice experience. The arrival time will be delayed because of COVID but it’s to be expected.",2020-07-07 00:42:33,rycebox

I WOULD GIVE ZERO IF I COULD //// UPDATE!!! And i check my card to see if i got the money sent back maybe NOT A SINGLE DIME BACK!!

1206,do not buy from here,False,1,I’ve been using aliexpress for a while never had problems til one of the vendors sent me horrible hair and wouldn’t give me a refund there’s no way to contact aliexpress customer service so I’m still in the process of getting the money back from my bank.

The quality of things are well and the customer service if needed is helpful.  I only had one problem with one company for dresses but one error of a company does not omit the fact of aliexpress  being creditable for good service.  I would and have rescommend because of good service excellent prices and time base on delivery is normally well.,2020-01-31 13:30:27,cryoqnda
1208,Cheap Chinese crap,False,2,You will find some decent venders but many misleading ones. They show quality but send you crap. Had one guy send me an item I didn’t order and I opened a dispute and they wanted a picture of the tracking number and packaging even though i told them I received the package but it was the wrong item. The seller claimed they didn’t sell that item and Alibaba sided with there fellow china seller. I’m a Platinum buyer with no previous disputes and they took my money and sent me a counterfeit product.

Read reviews and be a careful shopper, but this is a site I have enjoyed using and will continue to use happily in the future.",2019-08-26 22:22:43,Slcstac
1212,Great site!,False,4,I ordered off of AliExpress for the first time the other day. It said it would take weeks to get my packages which I was ok with since it was from overseas. My first package arrived quickly and when I went to confirm I received the goods it asked to make sure I wanted to as AliExpress doesn’t pay the seller until the goods have been confirmed as received which I think is awesome! The site is easy to navigate and it also shows you suggestions. Would definitely recommend this site!!,2019-09-15 15:16:57,hrdhjyx

1214,AliExpress rocks!!,False,5,"I know!! This company operates out of China, but I have purchased quite a bit from them and most of the items have been fantastic. The company has quickly reimbursed me for the few pieces that had flaws. I have had to, on occasion, wait quite a long time for items to arrive, but the wait has been well worth it. The jewelry is darling and SO inexpensive!! I have gotten pieces that would cost way more in the states!! This company is great!!",2019-01-12 23:23:20,Doribaby!

The app is a little confusing to navigate sometimes, but in the end I'm able to do most everything from it. The only thing I can't figure out is how to use coupons. It's quite confusing. The app would also benefit from a ""home"" button to make it easier to get back to the homepage without passing through every other page visited beforehand.",2017-09-28 16:58:35,Aeg315
1217,How I feel about vendors on AliExpress!,False,4,"Love shopping on AliExpress, you have to be aware of some of the vendors you purchase items from, because some things could look or fit totally different from what you see online. But overall I’ve purchased a few great things! And if your looking for bundles! Please do your research on the vendors hair they have for sell! Ive purchased some good and some bad! But overall I love shopping on there, mainly for bundles.",2022-12-01 08:55:47,Cansha35
1218,Hdrr85,False,5,"I have ordered a few things from here, and even though on one occasion I didn't receive my item from the seller, alli itself made it clear and easy to process a refund. Over time I’ve built up confidence in their platform and will go as far as recommending it at this point. Just be mindful of seller ratings (as with any shopping site) and be willing to wait. It aint prime!",2022-11-03 21:02:35,hdrr85
1219,Good alternative if you don't have shops at your place or want to shop cheaper ;),False,4,"Not the best delivery, but good enough app to have items from the mass market. 
The best thing is the low prices. The worst - is delivery waiting time and also not all items are as described. 
As for the delivery - I'm still waiting for some of my stuff that should have been already delivered like 1-2 weeks ago! 
But the items that I received in general satisfied me :)",2022-09-21 03:27:11,Mariia Dimitriieva
1220,AliExpress in a whole,False,5,Great . Love how specified everything is I feel very safe shopping here . The tracking is amazing . Happy I’ve ordered so much stationery from u . Wish u had a list of all stationery stores just in case I haven’t found one etc but everything else is A+ happy with the Customer service and the 24 hour questions u can ask now . Happy and comfortable with this site .,2022-09-16 18:24:08,Stefanie4455
1221,Wish I hadn’t skipped AliExpress this entire time,False,5,"What a great site! I’ve had nothing but good experiences with AliExpress, and to think I skipped over it all these years when looking for certain products. The prices made me think it was too good to be true. There may be some fishy listings, but I’ve dealt with no one but highly vetted shops on the site, and have only been pleased with my experience of them!",2022-08-20 12:27:03,FidgetFinder!
1222,Made a fan out of me!,False,5,"New to AliExpress and was surprised to be enjoying it- too much so! A lot of items I have been buying are not available in the 🇺🇸, or pricier, so I resorted to buying overseas. Surprisingly, the two batches I ordered only took 8-10 days to ship! And they are of good quality! Shame I only discover AliExpress now! Refunds are accomodated fast as well. Will continue to shop here from now on. 👏🙌",2022-08-09 02:34:26,Sam1g4
1223,Wonderful app!,False,5,It’s a great shopping app and i am very satisfied! You can even chat with the sellers if you need to for whatever reason regarding the product. My only complaint is that the in app tracking on the products isn’t always accurate. Like for example one product i ordered showed up at my doorstep while tracking still says “departing country of origin”,2022-06-20 15:03:44,zephyrblaze
1224,Cancel order does not work,False,3,"Beware! If you place an order and you hit the cancel button while the order is in processing it does NOT cancel. I ended up with two items that I did not want because the seller had it in processing for over a week so I hit cancel and ordered from another seller. Well , sure enough, 5 days after I cancel the seller ships it saying that cancel does not mean that it got cancelled only that I requested it be canceled. Other than this I love the app and use it a lot. Just beware.",2022-07-06 03:51:07,Bob194557
1225,Great improvements,False,5,The app has improved over the years which is great I mostly used it to buy phone cases and other small thing but I greatly recommend it I bought my prom dress for my senior prom and I got a lot of compliments on it you have to be careful who you buy from because the items sometimes aren’t like the pictures but I haven’t experience that yet,2022-04-29 21:14:37,Bubbles 246834
1226,Great watch!,False,5,"It’s alright, the fabric isn’t the best but it fits the price, overall my 10 year old daughter likes it, and the shipping came a bit quicker than I expected. When you get it the time won’t start so in order to start it you have to click the small button on the right side, then if you hold it up close to your ear you’ll hear a faint ticking sound.",2021-12-28 16:34:54,ela in e
1227,"Despite slight delays in shipments, most products are very good",False,4,"I’ve been buying stuff from AliExpress for about 6 years and have found that most of the items do arrive as promised.  Clothing is typically a bit smaller than expected and it can difficult to calculate sizes because they use the metric system.  Depending on the products, they usually look & perform as described; however, just like in the USA, the anti-aging beauty products are mostly  wishful thinking.",2022-03-29 16:35:31,kimesq25
1228,App Review - Layout very confusing,False,4,"I have been happy w purchases. That being said, the app itself is not very visually appealing. It’s confusing. I have struggled to find the home page more than once. Can be hard to navigate to the search bar/main page. I think there is too much going on, a lot of colors, moving stars, coins etc. Would definitely use more if it was a more simplistic and user friendly layout.",2022-02-16 17:31:15,Erica B in LA
1229,Mr.,False,5,Great Apps for consumers and personal users who are not in the wholesale businesses and interested in personal use or small volumes of Alibaba to be able to purchase as little as a single item from Alibaba's manufactures. Avoid the Minimum Quantities Order from most of vendors and manufactures listed on main Alibaba market app. Love the app and love all the sellers I had been doing business with so far. Great app and great market for everyone.,2021-08-24 04:11:41,SonnySunday
1230,Good place for deals,False,5,"Aliexpress is a great place to buy products. Most of the sellers are respectable, and honest. Other sellers are liars and thieves. Do your research before ordering a product. Look at their shipping reviews, and buyer satisfaction. Buyers will try to warn you of dishonest sellers. Aliexpress does nothing about these sellers, but will almost always side with you in disputes, (after the seller hangs onto your money for as long as possible.)",2021-03-15 21:50:58,kreusalel
1231,App review,False,3,"I wish you could sort the results of a search by price. And I wish they made the sellers give the dimensions of the items they are selling . I wish you would make the sellers be honest about what they are selling. Also give us a way to speak to the sellers before a transaction
You have to be very careful. Many sellers advertise things as being genuine when they are not. I’ve been burned several times. It’s hard to reach the sellers and there is no way to talk to Ali customer service. Buyer Beware!",2021-07-09 08:04:41,jositravinski
1232,Excellent retailer,False,5,"There are many choices for every category, from clothing, home use, jewelry, electronics, and more. They did an excellent job at handling my disputes because I didn't receive any of my 11-18 orders that I brought in September. They refunded my money, but I was pretty sad not to get them. But thank you to all the sellers for working with me. I will continue to shop here for all my small jewelry business needs.",2021-02-28 19:12:49,gggtnn232
1233,Excellent,False,5,"This app is very easy to use. The products are as varied and complete as anyone could need. The prices are much better than you can get in the states. The service is incredible, if there is a problem they are eager to solve it as expeditiously as possible, in the buyers favor. As in most online shopping they offer several ways to attain bonuses and treats. Highly recommend",2020-12-27 21:50:57,lindab137
1234,Best shopping app ever,False,5,Love this gem! If I could give 10 stars I would! I’ve ordered off this site for years love everything that I’ve received I have had some issues with certain sellers but no big deal that’s why I always use a credit card and not a debit card your credit card company will Dispute if you did not receive but eight out of 10 items I always get and I always love it especially for the price,2020-10-27 03:03:36,Appalussa lavaloosa
1235,Mixed feelings,False,3,"I have mixed feelings about this app. Some of the items are great. My issue is I have ordered items but only received a portion of the order but my money was released to store. It’s frustrating because I emailed and continue to be told I will get my order but it has been awhile. I paid for items i never received. I am trying to be understanding due to covid but feel like I lost out. Frustrating considering covid has made money tight for all of us, you think you’re getting a good deal but in reality You end up paying more for less.",2020-12-04 18:38:10,Credit concerned
1236,Best website ever !!!,False,5,"I’m so in love with AliExpress, I have tried others but AliExpress has never let me down and the quality has been 100% all the time . One very happy customer who will keep using AliExpress for a long time
I know that the quality is great hands down ! If there’s ever been a problem you have always been great about fixing it , so once again thank you so much and I can’t wait to keep buying more things 😃",2020-07-21 02:16:05,lovepink1964
1237,Superior by FAR to evilBay,False,5,"Imagine all the cool stuff made in China without the evilBay or scAmazon middlemen impositions and their greedy price abuse. 
Not looking back here.
Yeah, deliveries take a bit longer because AliExpress is not allowed to compete in a free market setting and they get artificially slowed down by “obscure forces”, but for me this is an incentive to let those antiDemocratic and anti freeMarket thugs that their pathetic practices are not being overlooked by the public and so this is how they don’t see a dime of my cash!
Thanks AliExpress!!!",2020-07-08 21:27:57,haus728292
1238,Best app I have ever gotten,False,5,"I only really use this app to buy stationary and I got to say that out of all the stores I have gone to and bought stationary, AliExpress has the cheapest and very cute stationary. Of course the shipping takes a while and not all the things you buy will come as promised but for the price they give it’s to be expected. If you can’t afford to pay for stationary items at a physical store, then AliExpress is the best place for you to shop.",2020-05-25 23:51:57,Fevibyde
1239,Poor claims processing,False,4,I order all the time and usually great results. However i dislike the claims process for unreceived goods. Orders fail to ship and then time passes and are auto closed. The order disappears from the open orders filter. Very challenging to find it again and then open a dispute. Dispute is always a challenge as well. Hard to submit and hard to track the progress.  Best if you could confirm the goods are received before they are closed. Seems very unfair to the buyers who purchase a lot.,2020-04-27 15:02:36,ReFash Studios
1240,Usually pretty Good...,False,5,"corona time has affected delivery times, but usually tracking and delivery date range is accurate, I have never ordered one thing and received something of less quality than I have expected. Sizes are a bit smaller because they use Asian sizes, but just pay attention to that and you will receive high quality clothing. I also like to buy colorful fairy lights and highlights from here very cheap and cute.",2020-04-16 12:35:38,Allyluvsja
1241,I am digging this.,False,5,"It is easy and safe to order on this app. 
I was a little reluctant at the beginning but have been surprised of the quality and the fact that transactions happen smoothly and ship pretty fast too. I receive a notification when the companies ship so I have never worried about ordering. I have had Good communication with sellers if I wanted to contact them. Taking everything into consideration I rate this 5 stars.",2019-03-23 21:40:06,Abzerov
1242,Quite frustrating,False,1,"I bought a nice shirt for my girlfriend that she was going to use as a Halloween costume. Ordered really far in advance to make sure it got here on time. 
The seller did not put the address I gave them correctly on the shipping label, so the package never came to me or my local shipping carrier. 
The costumer service was absolutely ridiculous, full of broken English and google translate. Halfway through our messages the person helping me switched to Portuguese mid sentence for no reason. 
When I finally was able to open the dispute case, the seller tried to low ball me on how much I got back, and then wouldn’t give me a full refund even though it was THEIR fault, not mine.",2019-10-13 19:41:40,raneydaygaming
1243,A challenge that’s worth it,False,3,"Navigating this application is difficult. There are lots of scams and questionable listings. Sellers constantly use the same stock photos, yet the products themselves vary in quality depending on the seller. If you can sift through the junk listings, you can get good quality products at great price. Shipping can be a nightmare and sometimes takes months. Although it can be challenging to find a good seller, they are out there. I have found a few good ones. They have good quality packaging, 30 day shipping, and great customer service.",2019-10-09 08:02:14,Mekfhgfisndh
1244,Good to find cheap things online,False,4,"its very easy to find what you’re looking for. some shipping takes a very long time tho and thats the only thing i hate. other than that quality isnt bad, i’ve bought necklaces from here and they’re pretty nice quality for just $10. they even look like real gold. i recommend this app for everyone but if you want to buy something for someone order 2 months before they need the gift in case. some shipping takes forever!",2019-08-14 00:33:03,Amaria Mayfield
1245,in general good enough,False,4,I’m disappointed in some transactions because you can’t rate or complaint when the seller close automatically a transaction even you don’t received the item others not even respond your texts so you can’t do nothing because even aliexpress don’t have a custuner service (with a person) in order to explain what’s going on the sistem you have it’s so basic you can’t even choose what it’s there because none of them it’s your problem :(,2019-04-16 02:36:05,brocioo
1246,Quality at a Low Price,False,5,"This app is very easy to navigate and place orders through, Im amazed at the deals sometimes, and found that coupons are offered by a lot of the vendors selling on AliExpress. Great place to shop for beauty products to kitchen gadgets, and I’m able to save money. Tracking is often included when an order ships, I’ve never had a package lost or late considering the location it ships from. Highly recommend",2018-11-13 12:39:54,ape0803
1247,Watch the dispute time period!,False,1,"Usually aliexpress has been well for me and I have bought many things and the items usually arrive on time before the dispute time ended. However, I have been talking to a seller that has stopped responding to me about an order I have ordered. It says it has came, but I’ve been asking the post office and it has not. So I asked my seller and they said to wait because it takes a while to ship overseas and since the dispute time has ended, I can no longer dispute the order. It has been months and I am not able to get the money back as the seller would not refund. The item is also discontinued so I can not do anything.",2018-11-20 07:04:08,HoneyMizu
1248,Great,False,5,"I love Ali express, whatever you are going to buy just look at the reviews and photos in the reviews to see that the product is good or bad & buy it but don’t get a few bad experiences and down them because the company is still up and running because obviously there are people out there getting good services from them and it’s many.

Just shop better & you will be a happy customer like me & many ❤️",2018-10-21 16:56:29,aishndjjdjdjd
1249,Love it!,False,5,"I have been shopping on Aliexpress since a few years and through my experience the quality has gotten much better than even a couple of years ago. You can basically get anything from here and as someone puts it, it can be addictive lol.. I buy all my clothes here now and if you do your research right, you can get great stuff for great value just look at reviews. This app is fantastic I won’t be without it!",2018-05-15 20:02:28,Jacquelinetlh
1250,App works the way you want an app to work,False,5,"I used this app for the first time and I have no complaints. It is easy, saved my choices and allowed me to purchase with no pressure. Also, without losing the items I chose considering the fact that there are hundreds of items available and you can easily forget some of the things you were browsing. This app works the way you would want an app to work.",2018-02-14 06:30:02,TexEdition
1251,DOWNLOAD ASAP,False,5,"Whether you are drop shipping or buying for personal needs Ali express is amazing for both. I am a Muslim Hijabi and finding modest clothing is very hard, Ali express has made it so much easier for me. All of them are trustable sellers. Not only are the clothing that they make made of good material they are also at a very reasonable price. I would 100% recommend to every single person that would ask me.",2022-11-05 16:09:05,NaushinU
1252,AliExpress does not care about their customers,False,3,I have ordered several things from AliExpress probably over 100 items by now and out of the hundred I probably have not received five and out of the five. I only got a rebate of 2. They ask you why you did not receive your item!? How the heck are we supposed to know why we did not receive it? Stop asking the customer why we did not receive our package we have no idea why! Not too happy with them at the moment!,2022-11-29 14:28:21,Care about the customers!
1253,Shop from one place,False,4,I have found that if I place an order with one vendor and order multiple items from them my delivery is faster and I get my items. I find that if I order 1 item from a vendor I commonly do not get the item I ordered. If an item comes and it can be shown it is incorrect then the refund process is easy. However try to get a refund when an item does not arrive it is more difficult.,2022-11-20 03:02:35,Samantha261979
1254,Better than you’d think,False,5,"This app has a bad rep, but there are some amazing products on AliExpress for the price they’re offered at. You need to be a little creative and look at reviews when finding what to buy, but overall the products are pretty high quality from what I can tell and shipping time is almost always lower than expected.",2022-10-01 01:43:09,heyskrewyadad
1255,Great app,False,5,Very easy to use and great convenience. I have been shopping here for a little while now and enjoy shopping here. My 2 suggestion to them would be providing more live customer service instead of automated. The 2nd would be quicker delivery time. However I do understand that both US and China are worlds apart and quicker shipping would also be more expensive,2022-07-07 11:26:58,kingscorpian
1256,Great watch,False,5,The watch is great buy but not quite as heavy or nice as the picture shows. I am 69 years old and the watch is a beautiful timepiece but a tad hard for me to distinguish the hads from the background making it difficult to tell time with really focusing on the face. Basically not easy to read for me which is why I only game it 4 stars but may be fine for most people. I love the watch RR Austin Tx,2022-06-10 01:20:13,Rayerobinson
1257,In loveeee,False,5,"If you ever think, dang this item is kinda pricy on a different store, you neeed AliExpress. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been saved by this app. The prices are amazing and item qualities are usually good. Just make sure to check the reviews and ratings. The shipping could take forever but thats a small down side. Amazing prices regardless. In love with this app that I almost wanna gatekeep it lollll",2022-05-29 21:37:18,sally woodsen
1258,Excellent but one concern,False,5,"Ali is great! I’ve ordered so many things from here and the descriptions match very well. One thing that I have trouble with, though is that After you order, you have no way to check when your order is expected by, except for when you first order it. Other than that, this app is Amazing! I 100% Recommend and I hope you download",2022-04-12 22:32:00,Theidiciedjfjr
1259,Very cheap But…,False,4,"As the title is, everything is very cheap so that comes with very long delivery time and sometimes fraud. About 1 out of 10 times the item might not come at all or bad quality like cannot be used at all. This is a problem with other shopping apps too but more relevant at AliExpress. Thankfully, most of the time these items are refunded for full price. So I will tolerate this problem in exchange for the extremely cheap prices.",2022-04-30 00:20:23,dbfjsebkisfhgfiuse
1260,Great,False,5,It is a great site. You have to do your research on the description and pricing. You need to remember that they are selling world wide and plugs and applications are different in China than they are in the US. If you can’t find the info in the description either contact the seller or don’t buy the item. I don’t like where it says free shipping and when clic on it there is freight on it. Shelby12 in the US.,2022-03-24 12:24:28,george1465
1261,App,False,5,"It is very hard to use the coins one builds up. There are not clear instructions on how to use the coins to get discounts. Another problem is when you do not receive your product and try to open a dispute you are given only 3 choices. There should be several reasons to open a dispute. Other than these 2 problems I like the app.

1263,Addictive,False,4,"This App is so addictive! I find so many cool things, (mostly jewelry) that would be so much more expensive if bought from a middleman here in the US. The markup on jewelry is crazy, but here you’re getting it right from the source so it’s so much cheaper! And the items are usually good quality! I recommend! It’s fun! I love being able to see photos of products from other customers who have left reviews! This app is my secret gem!",2022-01-21 16:45:42,GsMommi
1264,Horrible,False,1,They sent me wrong items and damaged items these last few buys I made and they want me to pay 200$ to ship it back I also shipped 3 items back with same tracking label and I only got refunded for 1 there customer service is horrible they don’t help you with anything it’s like a gamble on here I wouldn’t recommend buying anything from this site they mess up on orders and play with your money and have you running in circles to get your money back and you don’t even get your money back they keep telling you to wait 48 hours everytime you talk to them until your time is up,2021-12-21 11:14:13,majesty30
1265,Great clothes but shady prices and products,False,4,"A lot of the shops are shady so read the reviews thoroughly and make sure they have pictures. But I’ve found some really cute pieces here (but I bet a lot of them are knock offs tbh). If your here for fashion though, be warned that a lot of the alternative clothes are for really skinny people and they’re smaller than you would expect. So size up and look at the description for size measurements before you waste your money.",2021-12-14 21:20:09,Merlin'sBeard
1266,Great app,False,5,"Lately they improved shipping a lot, tracking is easier and delivery is much faster than the months and months I was used to; 
Whenever having things right away is not a priority, I’m happy to wait some days more and have an item for about half the price that some scalpers apply selling the same thing on other platforms. 
I wish Aliexpress the best fortune!",2021-09-23 10:24:42,amarogiulianoni
1267,AliExpress app,False,5,"I love this app! Although it prompts me to spend money😆 some of the things I order have taken a really long time. But I have had no issues with the items being broken. The items I’ve bought that I received have been in fairly good shape and quality. It takes so long to get to me(USA), I’m not sure if I want to order again.... who am I kidding; I’m ordering right now😆🤫",2021-03-26 21:43:42,Llfoley
1268,AliExpress,False,1,Every single seller on there is a scammer and AliExpress protects these scammers. I bought shoes to go with my outfit for my college graduation . The shoes I received were two shades of color and the sizing was in UK size when I ordered it in US (which is depicted in the charts they had). Now in order to get my money is to return them which I don’t mind if THEY paid for shipping which they won’t. I am not paying between $30 to $81 to ship a package back which is more than what I paid for the shoes. It’s sad because I’m not the only one they ripped off and stole from. If you check Twitter there’s a plethora of artists and buyers who’ve been scammed .,2021-04-13 21:04:06,Warren1997!
1269,App still has lot of room to improve,False,3,"AliExpress is a great platform for shipping, however, there are many improvements they have to do in the app, it is not user friendly, such as I have to click on the order, and inside that page, I have to click on the icon of the item again, in order to access the tracking info, another thing is there should be a cancel order button so the buyer dun need to wait for 10 days after the delivery",2021-03-31 15:57:56,GaryAppLeJr
1270,My new shopping obsession,False,5,"I make bookmarks and other things to sell, and this has become my go-to source for supplies. I haven’t had a single shipment go astray (even with the postal service problems these days). The tracking info is detailed and accurate, and they combine individual orders into a larger package to reduce the risk of something getting lost. Prices are great, shipping costs are more than fair.",2021-03-26 21:11:06,Mom to Autie Boy
1271,Kids grow fast,False,5,I spend so much money on clothes every year to keep their growing bodies covered. This website has given them so many choices for a responsible price. If you have to wait a moment for things to arrive but it is well worth it. They also have lego dragons which my daughter has already bought most of them. I highly recommend this site.,2021-02-28 16:46:04,Candi in Oregon
1272,Great App,False,5,"I love AliExpress the only thing I’d like to change is allowing me to create more wishlists, and also an easier way to edit the wishlists without having to go through the entire list and allow more than 20 items to be moved or deleted at a time! Also I’d like to be able to continue at the place I left off when moving items to a different wishlist not have to start back at the top!",2020-11-07 08:56:44,kleecurcio
1273,Search engine could be far better,False,3,"Overall I am satisfied with the app but not as much with the site. Searches show 30-50% what you entered as search terms but the rest of the results are mainly things you looked at before, even if they have nothing to do with your new search. Searches seem to mainly focus on your first term, so you can get different results based on the order of terms.  Hint: click on the  “Orders” tab in searches and that tends to mainly focus down to your actual terms.",2021-01-23 18:23:44,Jesus'sgirl
1274,Mostly awesome,False,4,"Lots of great stuff, I just wish they wouldn’t mark my stuff as “received” automatically and then say that I already said I received it. No, I didn’t. If I submit a dispute before the scheduled arrival, they tell me to wait, but if I don’t, they say I am agreeing I received it. That’s not how anything works.

1275,It’s great,False,5,"I was hesitant to shop on AliExpress but gave it a chance anyway. It was worthy. I’ve had a great experience so far. Shipping was fast considering the pandemic and customs. It is pretty much like the other online store we know in the US. It might take long for some items to arrive, it’s not the sellers fault but bureaucracy. In fact if the post office wasn’t so messed up my items would be here quicker. Keep that in mind and shop early. Good luck",2020-11-03 14:38:53,SpicyChicka
1276,Good companies,False,5,"I happy that was able to find a good hair company/ manufacturer. They shipped fast and the quality of their products were on point. I like that they “go live” on the platform and show case their product. That means they really care about providing quality products. The app is easy to use to buy and track your packages. Just with anything, you gotta find quality sellers and work with them.",2020-09-29 02:22:33,Student Lawyer
1277,Best place to shop online,False,5,"Most things are very cheap and you can easily get coupons to save even more money. I usually shop for cute stationary and clothes. 
It’s also easy to get refunds if what you ordered came damaged.

Most things I’ve ordered takes a while to arrive, but I know that’s probably because of COVID...
However, I feel like the tracking isn’t that accurate and the delivery date is kinda vague ? For example, ‘September 5 — September 30th’ That’s like a 4 week difference.
The tracker also said my package was halfway there but it actually arrived today. 
I have to use another app and website to check the tracking.

But other than that, I think the app is great and I would recommend to others",2020-08-29 20:23:00,EMM_05
1278,I love AliExpress,False,5,"I love this app. There are so many options to buy all around the world. Sometimes shipping takes a long while, but it is very much worth the price. If I have questions about an item, I usually get a reply within 24hrs. Read the descriptions carefully so you know how big and how many items you are getting. I admit I was hesitant at first, but this app is very easy for me to use and I bought many items. I’m hooked!",2020-08-17 03:21:24,JaninaNinaS
1279,Aliexpress,False,4,"I started collecting dollhouse items through Aliexpress. To date they have honored all my issues. I have received miniatures that are awesome and look fabulous in my miniature shoppe. Several I didn’t purchase because shipping cost being higher than the miniature itself. Yet, I don’t think they would ship the items fast enough.  Sigh... and hoped that the cost wasn’t that high.

Unfortunately, I have received a couple of articles that were not of the same quality, as described.  I just have not used that seller,  anymore.  I have purchased a dress and told no longer available, after the purchase and could not get a comparable replacement.  In all fairness, seller did try to resolve.
I like Aliexpress so much because you never know what you might find on the site!!
Overall, great site, great products and great prices!!

1281,Card Info Stolen,False,1,Buyers beware. I have had my information stolen 2 times since using this app and never had it happen before then. I did not know it was aliexpress the first time. I got a new card and aliexpress was the first place I used it and my information was stolen again and I had to get a new card. So yes you get super cheap stuff but at what cost? They take your card information. It’s not just one store they have different vendors and some of them are rude as well. There are a lot of scams involved. This one store didn’t send my item on time so aliexpress canceled the order and they were trying to get me to send the money still and got mad when I didn’t.,2020-05-07 16:29:02,Desi1212

It appears sellers are able to manipulate the ratings. That’s not right. I shouldn’t have to read all the reviews to see what the real quality is of the product. 
Love buying quality products at a good price. 
Just need more protection from low quality sellers. Thanks Eddie.",2020-04-11 12:00:45,ebm1973

1284,Ok as shopping apps go,False,5,"Easy to maneuver through site.  The search engine won’t allow any exclusions and returns items in the search that are nowhere near what I was searching for.  They also allow sellers to post a price for an item, yet not have anything for that price in the listing.  Buyer beware some sellers are rip offs be very careful to read reviews not only for the item you want but other items in that sellers store.",2019-09-15 02:15:03,FAT $$$ CHICK
1285,Great website to save some money,False,5,I have ordered my wedding dress and my bridesmaids dresses too even my husbands wedding suit and now my sister ordered her wedding dress too. You just have to read reviews and look at the pictures so you can make a wise decision because they’re some bad sellers out there but it’s worth the time to look for the good ones. Make sure you check sizes they are a little bit different from your country measurements.,2019-09-10 19:29:03,Dcompras
1286,amazing,False,5,"this app is really great I didn’t make this feedback until I ordered a lot of stuff and saw what it was like to order from here. It’s really great and you get free shipping on most items which is a plus!

AliExpress is a way BETTER App.",2019-08-04 03:19:58,maeylie
1288,Review on the stores and app,False,3,Most of the features in this app is great. A lot of choices from different stores. The downside is some stores do not really communicate and some of them don’t have the bigger or smaller sizes that we are looking for. The photos of the products that the store posts are not consistent with the quality of the actual product. It would have been nice if stores will be honest with the products and this app should have a way to filter those inconsistencies. But over all this app is great and some stores are amazing.,2019-09-01 16:09:48,.florra
1289,"Great app, great deals",False,5,"Almost everything we ever buy comes from China. Why not buy direct, and pocket the disproportionate middle-man profit? Some deals that appear too-good-to-be-true really are, so beware. But more often than not, the “good deal” on AE simply reflects the absence of huge markup we’re accustomed to paying for. The most obvious hangup with buying through AE is waiting for slow shipping—anywhere from 1-3 weeks. In most cases, it’s worth the wait, for the great price.",2019-06-11 02:40:57,jeremy1rose

I’m always looking for cute and unique things and this is my go to stop for that. Not to mention the various payment methods are very convenient!

I get so many compliments for the stuff I use from Ali Express. Most of the stuff is exceptional quality. Especially Kinel jewelry. Same items sell for much more online or in stores. Thank you. ❤️🙏🏻

The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is due to delayed shipping and not being able to reach customer service by phone. Otherwise all good.",2018-10-25 17:48:58,Bina Patel

It's hard to find good hair in the area I live, but thanks to Ali Express I can order hair and hair products with ease. You'll take a gamble ordering from the different vendors. I've had good and not so good purchase experiences. If your interested in my personal opinion Alicrown hair has very good products (wigs) they puts much care into the packaging. They even send a nice little note along with your purchase. Very fast shipping too which makes me an even happier customer.",2018-07-25 05:23:58,Sassysinglemom
1294,I was Nervous,False,5,"Anytime you try something new there’s some hesitancy but no fear with AliExpress! They’re honest and keep the companies that sell through them honest. I placed an order for some other items and after a couple of days, Ali contacted us and said, “we’re refunding your money because the seller never contacted you. “ that’s what you would expect from a quality operation.",2022-10-27 16:40:42,respective

If a delivery failure happens the first time it just won’t work also it’s really hard and nearly impossible to get a refund on anything they make it pretty hard so they can scam you,2022-09-25 03:35:07,driedpasta
1299,Many cute stuff,False,5,There’s literally everything you can ask for in this app. Long shipping though. Don’t get scam make sure read the reviews before buying.

1300,Satisfied Customer :),False,5,Ofc when ordering hair from various vendors it’s a hit or miss. But I can say I always receive in a extremely timely manner and I’m very rarely disappointed. I keep track of the vendors I’m satisfied with and I’ve only ran across 1 (literally) that I wouldn’t order from again. I feel that definitely speaks for itself & I’ve been ordering from AliExpress since I was about 16/17.,2022-07-05 22:35:56,@KennyyStyles
1301,Great buys!,False,5,"I've been shopping for years on AliExpress. Everything is pretty simple and straight forward.

1302,Pretty good except for,False,3,"The refund and return process. Seller sent me the wrong item and none of the options for opening a dispute are for being sent the wrong item. Ntm, I’ll have to pay for shipping myself to get a refund and it’s international which means I lose more than I’d get back. So now I don’t have the item and I lose my money. AliExpress will not help you if you receive the wrong item. Makes me lean toward not purchasing things anymore, especially if they’re more expensive.",2022-05-07 05:44:24,Clawchebecca
1303,AliExpress combined delivery is horrible,False,1,I’ve spent so much time and wasted money on items being placed in the wrong combined delivery bag. If you want to maybe see your item only order from one place and don’t order again for a week. I’ve received items for 15 people in different countries .. only two items that were mine were actually delivered. The rest were delivered to people in other countries. And the vendors didn’t refund because they are the item that’s in the combined delivery bag as being delivered … but it was sent to someone else. I’ve had too many bad deliveries to trust ordering again.,2022-03-26 23:02:51,equality seeking
1304,"Great till it’s not, then you’re outta luck and $$$",False,1,There’s a glitch in the system that gives the vendors an incorrect address for my orders. I’ve been trying to fix it for months with no assurance that the issue has been fixed and orders will ship to the proper address. I also only received a partial refund even though the address issue is not on my end. I have tried to go through the online representative but received no actual help. I send and email explaining the situation every 2-3 weeks  since Jan 22 and have never received a reply. There is no customer service when things go wrong.,2022-03-25 10:10:29,Hilari

I spent over $230 on this order,still haven’t received my money back. I did everything I possibly could ,contacted AliExpress,everything. They did nothing for me and I still have not been reimbursed!

1308,Absolutely LOVE this app,False,5,So I’ve been using this app only for about 3-4 months now. There are thousands of things you can buy on here. Wide variety of stuff that will suit anyone. The one thing I don’t really like is that they don’t ship things really fast. Some things I’ve ordered here took a month to come in. Maybe longer…but other than that I love this app so much. It’s addicting!,2021-08-21 19:43:56,Lyricalmind
1309,Wig is nice!!,False,5,"I placed my order and within about 5 days I received my order. The hair is very soft and true to length. I ran my fingers through the hair and got no shedding and it just has the typically hair smell which doesn’t smell bad.

1315,Great app 👍,False,5,I like AliExpress a lot. I have been ordering merchandise for 3 years on the app. You can buy decent jewelry and tools. The only thing I don’t like recently is the shipping takes way too long since last August. I understand it may be caused by the pandemic this year. However there are always ways to make it faster if the sellers want to. This is something AliExpress has to work on with your sellers. Thank you Ali. I still love you.,2020-05-26 16:57:13,Nuoffer123

The seller told me to contact my local post office.  they told me they haven’t received my package. I tracked the items and found that  they are in Chicago, I live in South Dakota. AliExpress told me they are not responsible for customer order being ship to a wrong address.😳  bad, bad experiences my daughters birthday is in 2 days time and I haven’t received the decorations items nor her dress that I ordered for her birthday from AliExpress.",2020-07-17 21:10:09,adrinshop

However, it became worse and worse. I placed four orders three months ago. Two of them arrived (two months later than expected date) and another two never arrived. The platform refunded one of them and asked me to wait for another. And they extended the purchase expected time by themselves and complete the order automatically, which is ridiculous. Also, the platform doesn’t have any real human customer service agent now. They are ROBOTS! I gonna delete the app definitely. Don’t use it.",2020-07-12 22:18:54,Lynne_zhou

You will not regret it. I bought my bridesmaid gifts here and several other pieces of gorgeous jewelry. Whoever created this ap: you are a wonderful person!

1330,Decently priced,False,5,This app has lots of everyday items that you can get from any other online retailer but you’re gonna pay a lot less. Paying less does mean your gonna wait for it but everything I’ve ordered has come in days to weeks before it was supposed to arrive. I’ll be continuing to shop from here for the foreseeable future,2022-11-21 05:00:34,rmcgee1986
1331,Quick shipping great prices,False,5,"I was skeptical at first because I had never heard of AliExpress but I’m glad I found them.   They were the only site to have a specific mold I needed and it came 2 weeks sooner than expected. Great communication and hassle free. Check them out. They have so much good, random stuff you can’t find anywhere else. 10/1 would recommend.",2022-09-19 21:09:13,Grenisha
1332,Aliexpres,False,5,I love this app bc its nice although my biggest worry is getting scammed and i always look out for that even when it seems like a really cute product. One time i ordered black eyeliner and waited foreverrrr for it just for it to come in orange. The orange was so ugly but i guess the eyeliner worked well. Ever since that happened i have a big fear of even getting the wrong color of something,2022-09-19 11:50:21,Xx_Lesbeangacha2533🦠
1333,Great deal and quality items!,False,5,Items are hit or miss. Be sure to read reviews and look at pictures. When you receive a good item it’s typically a goldmine and makes up for any lesser quality items! fun to search and scroll especially if you consider yourself someone who likes to hunt for a good deal for high quality items!,2022-07-16 11:21:49,valucas55
1334,I’m a newbie to AliExpress,False,4,"So for my first purchase one of the stores sent back my purchase , didn’t deliver my goods and can’t seem to get my goods yet I bought rhinestones for my clients clothes and everything went bad for me . Second store made me veryyy happy with a dress I bought for my mom third store I’m awaiting shipping so hopefully it works out . Just be careful who you buy from . I think once you do your research it’s a pretty good way of doing business.",2022-09-01 22:38:13,AveeBernard
1335,Fantastic Body!!,False,5,"Ordered this body as a replacement for an existing vehicle.  We wanted the white color, and I have to say, it looks great!!  The lighted really set it off.  If you own this carbon another color, I would recommend trying the white as an alternative or spare. It arrived almost a month sooner than expected.  The shipping was very fast, relatively speaking.  Customer service has been top notch!",2022-04-21 22:11:46,Xd40tac
1336,Need better shipping,False,3,"I love the variety of merch available through AliExpress but waiting MONTHS for it to arrive is painful.
Some of the stores are great -- they have good merch and ship quality items in a timely manner BUT beware there are some very shady stores that take your money and never ship the merch.
My advice if you're shopping on AliExpress, be sure to look at their star ratings, how many customers they serve and read those reviews. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it's probably a bad risk.

1337,New favorite shopping app!,False,5,So far everything i have ordered has been great! Some items take a little bit longer than expected but ive always received packages in good condition. On very rare occasions I have trouble with an order or two but most of the time seller sends new item or refund. One or two occasions only where item and refund were lost.,2022-03-30 04:17:16,gabyeiv
1338,Fantastic App! Love this store!,False,5,"This is really a great app. They make it easy to search for products by an image, which has saved me countless hours. If you have a problem with an order, it’s easy to contact the seller. If you can’t resolve the problem with the seller, the app makes filing a dispute very easy, and you get your money back quickly. I highly recommend!",2022-02-27 13:42:17,Aviatortwin
1339,Reviewing the Aliexpress App,False,5,Aliexpress App is a great site to navegate and explore good items at great prices. I’ve been a customer for many years now and I’ve bought some great items from them. The app is well organize and facilitates the customers to navegate and look specifically what they want. They have everything available.  Their deliveries arr garantized. Is a good app to buy!  I will continued using Aliexpress App!,2021-10-10 11:15:29,idstrong
1340,Chinese Christmas!,False,5,"We call this app Chinese Christmas at our house. After you order several things, you get nice surprises after a few days/weeks in the mail…. and you don’t exactly know what’s in the package with the Chinese writing. You open it up and it’s like a little Christmas present! Sometimes they package several small orders together. Those packages are super fun! 
It’s 中国圣诞节!!!",2021-09-09 18:25:16,Willigula
1341,Reluctant To Impressed,False,5,"I was not sure about using this platform, but it’s actually been a great experience across the board. You know there will be a bit of a wait to get your items, but the shipping speed is not at all bad, and you get email updates. You do sometimes pay for what you get, but for the most part it’s good stuff at really low prices.",2021-05-14 12:08:54,Esmerczak
1342,Great once you understand how to use,False,5,I’ve made several purchases and overall I’m happy with this app. It took me awhile to learn how to use this and alibaba but once I did my research and found some reliable suppliers I started having a lot of success with it.

1344,Convenient,False,5,"Everything you could want is found on this app. Things you didn't know existed can be found on this app. I like that you can add things to your cart to buy and they sit there until you purchase. On other platforms, the items would usually get deleted. This app is so easy to navigate through to make purchases.",2021-02-12 13:58:47,HotGyal AK
1345,Great app,False,5,"I bought a lot of things that I didn’t even knew I needed. Always check for descriptions of a product and size charts as stores that sell on this app are from China and sizing is more in a smaller size compare to European or US sizes, but everything I have ordered from them was great. As it comes from another country shipping does take some time but overall I am loving this app.",2021-01-10 07:41:35,Katrina Liv
1346,Deceiving,False,1,"Sellers can reject your cancellation, even if they had plenty of time to cancel it. I was charged for something I asked to cancel in a timely matter. They even responded, but then next day, they shipped it off and was like, “ok, cancel it” . LOL What else happens? AlieExpress backs up the seller instead of me. Even though I had ALL THE PROOF TO SHOW, they still sided with the seller. I’ve never had an issue with AlieExpress for the several items I bought on it. After this. I’m done with it. This kinda stuff is what will make any company lose me as a customer. Being a seller myself, I would certainly not treat my customers this way. Good riddance.",2021-01-24 07:36:08,Do!!y

I just think it takes too much sometimes to receive the package (not really a problem but I think it should be faster) over all from all the stores I’ve bought I received everything.

1352,Rate the app not the store,False,4,So far most of the reviews on here have been for AliExpress and NOT the app. this is supposed to be an app review. Mostly I like AliExpress but prefer to not use this app. My original review stated how bad the app was. Went back to it just now and it had changed to its original look. I can use it but I can still not click a link from an email and be taken anywhere but general account. Not helpful. I will continue to shop directly from shop without app.,2020-05-22 18:31:11,Just Whisper
1353,Love AliExpress,False,5,Have been using this App for about 5 years now and am very happy with it.  They need to work on some of the translations for doing a search. Sizing for US customers is a problem.  Most of the women’s clothes I have purchased are generally 2 sizes too small. Sometime it is difficult to find what I’m looking for because they are not familiar with the English word but it seems to be getting better all the time.,2020-01-18 05:49:42,2 Doubloon

And I kept getting reason was Chinese holiday and all employees are off for a month?? If that is true, I wish I would hv been told my wait would be extended for an extra 30-45 days?  I hv had 2 products become unavailable, so I dad to cancel after 30 days being notified. I hv received 1 pair of shoes and they are great except inserts immediately had to be replaced, but shoes look cool. A lot of good things on site!! PATIENCE!!",2020-02-24 14:07:55,baseball 365!
1355,Great place to find deals,False,5,"I love buying stickers, stationary, washi tape, etc. but you can essentially find what you’re looking for in here. The prices are usually very nice— I’ve had nothing but good experiences thus far, and it’s my go-to. There’s a bit of a wait, since it’s based in China, and the tracking is a bit wonky (not accurate or reliable, so I just sit and wait LOL). 
Overall though, I love AliExpress and others shouldn’t be afraid to give this a shot.",2019-10-26 01:11:37,6f0909
1356,AliExpress Gold Member,False,5,"I Love This App, The Prices Are Unbeatable. Some Items May Take Longer To Arrive, Some May Arrive Way Before Time & Some May Never Come. All in all it’s a Gamble and you have to be patient and do a lot of research before making a purchase. Either Way it’s My First Go to App Especially When I Have Time, To Wait On Shipping, I’m So Grateful For The Free Shipping, The Easy Check Out and The Vendors Who Exceeds Their Customers Satisfaction.

1357,Awesome Online Shopping Experience,False,5,"I Love AliExpress it’s as close as you can get in the States to the real deal in China. The prices are excellent, the shipping is usually free and I’ve received everything I’ve purchased earlier that the date specified, a few times weeks early. When I’m in China I use Alibaba or BaiDu and there it always the next day and the cost is without comparison and the quality has always be better than expected.",2019-07-05 19:13:36,Switchart
1358,A lot can be improved,False,2,"They have the sellers back FAR more than the buyers. If the sellers sell something that is completely different than described, and you ask for a full refund, they will not give it. They will force you to take a roughly 30% refund and say that the only way to get the full refund is if you return the item but thats where they get you. Something that weighs only a few ounces to send back to china will run you $60 at USPS and $150 at Fedex, and they know that. So they know you will absolutely be taking the partial refund option. It’s a bit of a scam they have running.",2019-07-15 16:26:36,Paul D Ankus
1359,You get what you pay for!,False,5,"I love this app. You can get great deals. Just pay attention to the reviews!

1361,Awesome!,False,5,The app offers an amazing buying/selling platform worldwide and it does an awesome job at allowing fast and easy communication between the buyer and seller! Make sure that if you’re purchasing clothes from this app (or anything for that matter) you read the description carefully and look at the reviews of specific items! Most of the stuff sold here comes from Asia and ppl in America have larger bodies than the advertised sizing.,2019-04-08 03:28:30,YoBoyKhris
1362,Great app,False,5,Love this app! I use it all the time! It’s a hit and miss with it since all the products are made directly from China. I love that they cut off the middle man which is when products start getting expensive and not worth the price. If your Ofer is or isn’t what you expected can’t really complain especially for the prices. What do you expect? Most of the time the products are as described and reading reviews helps too!,2019-02-13 05:20:53,Monique00
1363,Great App overall...,False,5,This is a great app that I’ve used for the last several years with zero issues.  All vendors I have ever dealt with have been quick to rectify any minor issues with an order so there’s nothing but good things that I can say so I’ve changed this from 4 stars 2 yrs ago to 5 stars... Through the years upgrades have been made to the app to provide a better shopping experience for shoppers... Thank you!,2018-05-10 22:27:19,China Do11
1364,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NONEXISTENT,False,1,"If I could give them zero stars I would. AliExpress is not for their customers, they’re only about the money. The sellers lie and cheat you out of your money and then blacklist you so that you can’t contact them or write a review. And AliExpress horrible “customer support” team does not help you at all. They act as if there’s nothing they could do and they want you to resolve your own issue when you don’t receive your tracking information or your product at all even after contacting the seller with no response. I will never purchase from AliExpress and I wouldn’t recommend anyone else too either unless you like losing money.",2018-12-27 02:39:11,Mz_Me18

How am I gonna buy or use this app?! Every time I wanted to save an item I’d have to sign in, every time I tried to sign in AND register it would say my accounts where blocked it didn’t work sign in to renew or whatever and then it took me to a blank page when I wanted to change my password. I tried everything... I was so upset I didn’t use  it in a month or two went back to it same thing even more annoying. So I will stick to the website no app for me
Sadly :(",2018-08-24 05:05:45,RicoB:)
1366,This is a very easy to use app,False,5,"The icons are large and easy to figure out, it is easy to look at all your previous orders.  Contacting a seller is easy.   It could be improved if sellers listed their items more specifically- as in Christmas cutting die instead of just cutting die. Some do and some don’t.  Also, if all item dimensions could be listed in inches and cm that would make life easy for USA shoppers.  But overall a good app for shopping",2017-10-20 10:19:04,Hbkmom

Thank you again my friend I will definitely be ordering more from you!!,2022-11-11 04:24:49,Joshua A Sandoval
1368,Love shopping at Ali!,False,5,I do wish there were more people posting better reviews and photos to make purchasing better.

However, sometimesmerchsnts offer merchandise they do not have in stock or can’t fill your order. This is a problem buyers have to deal with. Caveat emptor!!!

But I keep getting recommendations for inappropriate “adult toys” and other weird stuff. I keep telling the app that I don’t want to see that kind of stuff but when I refresh the page all of it just comes back. This app would be great if the “I don’t want to see this” button worked as advertised, or maybe add a safety mode so that it wouldn’t show such inappropriate stuff.",2022-06-17 07:39:52,yayasees
1372,Awesome App!,False,5,Love 💕 this App. It has so many awesome items on it. Items that I purchased already are just like the seller describes. I love 💗 that it’s not expensive and so far from what I received there great materials not cheap looking.

1374,I love it but I spend too much money on here,False,5,"So cheap, but remember it’s because it’s wholesale so be careful of shady sellers. If they have great reviews and lots of orders, then it’s usually great!! Also remember the expensive things (ESPECIALLY CLOTHES) are gonna be the ones with any quality.

1376,This app’s vendors are garbage,False,1,I should have known (because most/if not all of the products originate from China) that a purchase from this would end poorly. I ordered one item ($30) to test them and they failed miserably. The item arrived broken. When I attempted to dispute this (after I sent them pics of the broken item) they told me to ship it back to them for full refund. The item was shipped from Kentucky UPS but … you guessed it … had to be shipped to China. The cheapest estimate for this .219 pounds of plastic was $90 through USPS. They know this — so they play this game. I’m done. Removing the app and never using it again.,2022-03-26 20:30:13,Jrudicous
1377,Ali Express,False,5,I have never got anything that didn’t look like the picture and there are a lot of cool items for low prices. The only downside is that it takes about a month or longer to get most items and if you get items from China or another country in Asia you have to adjust sizing by ordering a size up from what you normally wear.,2021-09-02 01:34:33,kg sau
1378,Good,False,4,"Been using Aliexpress for 9 years for lots of things like phone cases, hair extensions, and other things. It’s great and nothing else is like it, only thing i hate is their dispute process. If you have an issue with a product, you have to wait 30+ days until you can get help! Luckily all the vendors I have had issues with were honest people and got my money back to me in other ways!

Please ask merchants that sell seeds to put a botanical label  of what kind of plant seed is supposed to grow? As easy way to look up direction in language of country it be sent to! Or include set of directions in language where product is being sent! It’s illegal not to have chemicals labeled right!  Can be dangerous to?  Think AliExpresss is really fun !

1382,Great.,False,5,I’ve only ordered one thing off of it so far. It wasn’t a quick shipment because it came from China but it cost less. You can choose where the product comes from.

1383,Great source of quality items,False,5,I have been shopping using this app for a while now and the customer service is wonderful and most of the products are great (I have to admit I have been buying mostly paper crafts supplies like stamps and dies) but if there is a problem with your order they make it right in a very short time period. Very happy with this so far 😁,2020-12-11 20:00:23,Spatiela

I order something that isnt as described and i try to get customer service but im stuck talking to a dumb robot that doesn t  help.

They have great anime merchandise for cheap as well as anything else you could think of. I have also never had issues with getting a refund.",2020-11-05 17:08:36,Chhh0111
1389,BEWARE,False,1,"I’m warning everyone to delete this app and stop all business with Ali and Wish. Your payment information is NOT secure. A random Chinese phone was ordered by someone presumably thru The Mall Store. $890 was taken from my bank and upon getting the alert I found and cancelled the order. Ali Express is responsible for securing payment and refunds, I was informed it could take up to 20 business days to cancel the debit from the bank. Fraud was reported to the bank, now my account is in total limbo waiting for either ALI or the bank to return the money. Do yourself a favor and don’t risk this happening to you before Christmas, just to get knockoff junk at a cheaper price.",2020-11-16 07:53:10,Nancy3771
1390,Terrible,False,1,Never received one of the items because my shipment was combined without my consent and I paid for the extra shipping. The merchant refuses to except that I never received the item. I opened a dispute and it was denied and closed in the merchants favor when all I asked for was a replacement item. I purchased 10 items from several merchants why would I lie about not receiving one item. As much as I shop here I think this will be my last purchase on this platform. It's not the money it's the principle they are basically calling me a dishonest liar and for that reason alone I will not spend my money here. The worst online experience I've ever had.,2020-11-13 11:53:47,disgusted and disrespected
1391,AliExpress over eBay,False,5,"Yes AliExpress is the clear choice for me especially after dealing with eBay seller GreatBuyDirect 66 over their misappropriated lies and selling tactics... never buy from them, unbeknownst to me they have tons of customer complaints, so based on months of dealing with that headache, AliExpress is the clear choice winner for me, especially since I’m a self proclaimed online “shop-a-holic”, so if you wanna keep getting my money AliExpress.... keep up the good work.

1392,Browser kinks,False,2,"1.  It is frustrating when using AliExpress App in an iPad NOT to be able to rotate the application from Portrait to Landscape. 
2. Browsing should be open to a major category for user to decide and look for items interested, instead to be directed to articles that are irrelevant to the customer.
3. It should be MANDATORY for anyone that sales products through AliExpress to have a CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER to make inquiries as needed.
4. AliExpress should provide working schedules and open/closed hours to ensure availability os Customer Reps as needed.
5. Let the application ROTATE on the screen as needed. Portrait - Landscape and Viceversa.",2020-10-02 18:39:19,CustRep
1393,best. app. ever.,False,5,"I have been using this app for years and never got around to leaving a review but now I will! It is the best app in the entire world and the prices are always reasonable, yes the shipping takes approximately some weeks or months but it is definitely worth it!! I have always been satisfied with all the products I have received and if there ever was an inconvenience, the sellers would fix it asap!! Definitely the best app ever!",2020-05-27 22:38:45,lilpchy

The description says 10a, I opened hair, ran my fingers through and shedding and tangled immediately. I contacted the merchant for refund. They have been rude and unhelpful. They would not give me return address. It’s been 3 weeks since I did get the return address and returned there merchandise and still haven’t received a refund. AliExpress denied my dispute. I tried contacted on line help desk but it’s an automated system which is no help. I have still been contacting the merchant and they still will not help me to get my refund even after they received there merchandise. This is the most horrible experience!!!!",2019-12-23 15:58:27,LisaLewis86
1396,Love AliExpress,False,5,I love AliExpress .. you do wait a long time for everything and clothing is often a knock off but inexpensive  is an understatement .. just make sure when you receive item you confirm it so the vendors get paid ! And if something is broken tell them and usually if you take pics you will get a new item :) just like with everything else you get what you pay for ! But most vendors are very honest,2019-09-07 15:41:42,Smaisch666
1397,6 of the 9 Orders I placed have Issues,False,1,"At first the app was great, I received the first orders in a timely manner. Then I started to order more... AND GUESS WHAT?! I haven’t received anything. The dispute process takes about 2 months. When I informed the seller that I didn’t receive. They give me the run around. Like mark the order “complete” or tell me to wait additional 12 days and give them positive feedbacks. Like, hello fix my problem first then I can give you a feedback! I haven’t ordered from them since my last orders are messed up & taking forever for them to solve🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️. I’d rather shop with Ebay & pay more than to keep having this issue with AliExpress",2019-11-10 22:25:34,Lee1321
1398,My to go,False,5,"I usually use this app to purchase small items. I usually buy accessories, phone items, and other small items I would need. I haven’t had any problem with this app. Also the items that are sold are very affordable and that has good deals. The shipping could take a month but it just depends on your location. Therefore I would recommend to others to use this app.",2019-08-19 21:46:23,BG2197
1399,Affordable is a mild way to put it!,False,5,"I love AliExpress! I was a long-time Wish user until I found this app. Most products ship free and are much cheaper than what you’d find on Wish. Shipping is much faster as well, for the most part. That will vary by store of course. It is easier to navigate and each store is more user friendly and appealing to shop with than Wish. I love that you can filter and refine search results!",2019-07-15 16:35:33,Hippieeit
1400,Good app!,False,5,First timer here! So far I have not had an issue I’ve order a total of 4 things using this app. Notifications and updates are pretty good. Again no issues as of yet will continue to use this app and update if anything changes. As a first timer it’s easy to use and follow direction. I would recommend for those who are looking for a place to order cheap but good quality (so far) products.,2019-07-05 15:47:44,HKLulu27

Sometimes the items get so long to arrive to USA but that depends on the seller, I had receive items in 3 weeks another's take like 2 months longer. But you have to be patience become it comer from overseas, thanks Aliexpress 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼",2019-06-07 21:54:28,Netafan
1402,Broken earrings! Horrible Delivery!,False,1,These earrings would’ve been nice if two with them did not arrive damaged. After waiting an entire month I receive these items in a thin envelope with two of them broken. The seller did not take the time to individually bubble wrap these items. This is not sufficient for items that have to go through a long shipping process. When I contacted the seller they did not bother to answer my complaint. I usually place a small order with a seller first to see how good their service is and they failed. I was looking forward to buying more items and placing a bigger order but now I am turned off!,2019-06-16 15:19:57,Coffee Queen 32
1403,No flops yet,False,5,"Thus far I’ve yet to come across a flop! I like that there are usually interesting items, arrive quickly, and I’ve yet to be disappointed with my purchases. I do like the option that you can interact with each seller, as need, and appreciate that the app holds onto the money spent until you release it, within a reasonable timeframe, that way if there is any issue with the product it can be addressed.",2019-06-05 20:17:35,Offtheanchor
1404,AliExpress experiences,False,5,"I have been using AliExpress for about 2 years now to purchase items for my business. So far everything has been great and the customer service has exceeded my expectations. Of course some items have left more to be desired, but overall the quality of the products I have purchased were as expected. This is a great site for wholesale items and store products.",2019-02-13 17:06:30,Ali experience
1405,Frustrating,False,3,AliExpress is a good app not a great one because I’ve ordered many items and received only 80% of what I’ve ordered. A disputes have been sent and I’ve also contacted the stores under AliExpress and nothing came from it only to look at my post office with tracking number. I also like the deals that AliExpress has but I can’t give a 5 star because I feel that AliExpress should feel responsible for the items that customers don’t get or the refund we never received! AliExpress you would get so much more loyalty customers!,2019-03-05 01:42:11,diamond#13
1406,BE A SMART SHOPPER,False,5,"I always order from Ali Express and the shipment is great! Just read your reviews and comments even the bad ones and make sure you go and venture out to other genders because they may sale the same thing you’re looking for but it just cost cheater! So before purchasing, find out what’s cheaper AND has good reviews. I’ve saved so much money by venturing out because some things are cheaper on others’ pages.",2017-10-09 14:02:22,Treasure00
1407,I love this app!,False,5,They have great prices and there’s a lot of products that will ship for free. You can collect coins for more savings and you can get your first order for .01 if you chose one of the products offered for that amount. Shipping time is MUCH quicker than the date they give you and only took a couple weeks to come all the way from China.,2022-11-12 20:02:56,Casey20002014
1408,"Fun & You Can Get Some Truly Great Stuff, But Requires Patience",False,4,"It’s fun to look through because they have some crazy, fun, and random stuff on their. You take a gamble with the quality but I’ve got some top notch things! The downside is not being certain of the quality but mostly the long delivery time & some sellers aren’t the best with tracking. I’ve had stuff come 2-3 months late. It’s easy to ask for a refund though.",2022-11-14 21:11:23,bra layh
1409,"Nice product, recommend",False,5,"Received in bulk package.  All items intact and as described.  Issue is, package mailing label is SO LIGHT, barely readable that the postal staff had to hand write the address to be able to deliver.   If not rectified at shippers end, it will be a problem down the ways.  
This set of nails and then some will be debuting at a party this weekend.  Looks like will have to reorder.  Nice product and highly recommend!",2022-08-16 20:01:13,gingercross1
1410,"Great app with great variety, just a bit confusing to navigate and use.",False,4,"I honestly think the variety and pricing (besides the shipping) and ways to earn bonus credit is amazing compared to what other e-commerce platforms offer. The only downside is I think it’s a bit hectic navigating all the options and the UI, as well as coins, promotions, and coupons and how to properly redeem them. Other than that, amazing.",2022-10-06 02:20:40,Dylan Manarang

1412,Love Ali Express,False,5,"Ali Express has so much to choose from and has so many different prices. They stand behind me as a customer and are very fair when a product is damaged or of poor quality. I have received so many excellent products, as well as a few poor quality products. All in all, AliExpress is a great place to purchase for your small business.",2022-03-14 04:32:24,ccrapjs
1413,Awful.,False,1,Every item is bait and switch. They show a picture of an item at a cheap price then there are 14 options. The item pictured is triple the listed price. One of the options is a smaller version or an acccessy for the listed price. Shipping times are slow on most items and allot of vendors are scammers. Only deal with someone who has a proven sales history.  I’ve received 2 empty envelopes so far. Customer service refunded me but still a month and a half after placing my order and waiting for an item to arrive. None of these apps are what they used to be. They all do the same things.,2022-06-11 14:43:33,hfjdjksnnd
1414,Surprisingly amazing,False,5,"Everything I bought so far great, some items might be one size too small, but the material and quality of sewing in the clothes, are great stander. I reorder if a item too small. I never ask for refund, the prices are great, why bother. And yes the wait on shipping can be from two weeks to 3 months, in my opinion it worth the wait. ^_^ happy customer.",2022-02-17 04:21:43,"D,ais"
1415,Thank you AliExpress,False,5,I gave them 5 because they are not that badwith shipping out your package deliver. But I truly highly recommend it to make a account with them and talk to the seller before you order something because if you don’t You will be very upset with your order/package. You can’t blame AliExpress only yourself so be careful ladies & gentlemen. Have a nice day everyone. Thank you AliExpress:),2022-01-27 01:16:00,jeremiahmami
1416,Good Platform,False,5,"I just found out this shopping platform and like it. The tracking system is very good and all purchase information is saved for tracking. I had some bad experiences with some sellers such as missing products, defective product, bogus sales. I had dispute with the seller, AliExpress was able to step in to protect buyers interests. I feel safe to purchase here.",2022-01-04 19:31:44,skehg1v
1417,Hit or miss,False,5,The app itself has a great algorithm for suggestions based on what i’ve liked. Theres a photo search option which i use all the time and is extremely accurate. So many unique items are on here- and there’s plenty of good quality products (along side really atrocious ones) just remember to always check the reviews!,2021-08-13 17:14:33,mieh6969420666
1418,Real Shopping,False,4,"Affordable and attractive things! From high end to low end. Buying clothing can be very sketchy due to the sizing difference! Always buy larger than your normal size! Great place to buy hair! Refunds sometime take awhile and you may loose a little more by doing the return, this process definitely could use some work. All in all for the most part, this is an excellent site to purchase from👍🏼Life’s a gamble anyway",2021-12-22 03:14:35,SecretShopper21
1419,Read reviews,False,2,I have ok luck on this app. Very good deals and shipping has been pretty quick. I did order from the Bling store and my order was wrong. I tried to reach out and zero communication and ignored! So make sure who you buy from communicates back with you to avoid having to return and wait like I am going to have to do!!! Also read reviews some of the things I received were terrible and spilled everywhere. Amount was not as described and wasted money. I have disputed and will do another review if someone actually responds back.,2021-08-10 19:39:06,tleigh72
1420,“Great Affordable fashion and beyond.”,False,5,"Would recommend for shopping just shop ahead of the need and be patient, shipping typically takes 2-4 weeks. App is very straight forward it’s based on an algorithm so it will eventually suggest what your looking for once they see what you like, so don’t get discouraged at first. Give it some time and play around with it! Tip: use buzz words and trendy names.",2021-05-15 03:53:36,KayMahogany
1421,Most of the time trustworthy,False,4,I like buying from this app as whenever some issue comes up they really make sure to fix it. The delivery is the only issue when it comes to shipping it from sellers. I had 2 items I ordered sent to the wrong address the seller put. But not all are the same and I recommend only buying from sellers that had many other people buy from that gave good reviews.,2021-06-25 18:04:10,XxDope_D.xX
1422,The products don’t always arrive,False,3,"Be very careful of keeping track of your orders and when the order protection expires 30 percent of the times you wont get your product. Very sloppy tracking system. I use to order a lot but then started getting screwed over by not receive my orders now I only get the few things that were worth it, and it’s a lot easier to know when it’s been way too long and the item never arrives and have to submit a claim.",2021-05-25 22:43:44,GraciaHill
1423,Useful,False,5,I’ve used AliExpress more than a few times now and every time it’s exceeded my expectations. Products ship quickly and usually arrive within two-to-three weeks. The products I’ve ordered have been surprisingly good quality for the low cost. Overall I would recommend AliExpress to anyone looking for more affordable products.,2021-03-31 15:42:43,mickey (not a mouse)
1424,Only cause.,False,3,"The reason why I give it a 3 star is cause there’s been countless of times that I did not get my order. I got my refunds. But the refund is not what I wanted. I really needed what I had ordered. And there for since AliExpress never handed the lost items they only get a 3 star. Maybe if they can fix mixed addresses spelled wrong or just don’t consider in making an effort to find out what cause the mix up. I’ll then change my vote from three to 5 like it should be. Sorry AliExpress it is what is.

1425,App review,False,1,"I find it difficult to navigate. The search gives me too broad a range of merchandise than what I put in the search so I end up spending too much time looking for what I want. 
I have no idea what this coin reward is because their is no explanation of it or how to use it. 
I am sure there is much more merchandise on here that I would purchase if I knew how to find it. 
Last year I bought something that I never got and lost money on so I was afraid to even come back on here because many vendors don’t accept PayPal which protects my purchase. 
I could say much more but I’m sure I got my point across.",2021-04-09 15:36:51,susan gail
1426,Find what you need and more!!!,False,5,Cool app. Has pretty much anything you could want or need to purchase. Many things for low prices. Many offered products have very quick shipping and arrival dates. Quick and responsive employees from different stores located within this one app. I love that they even offer many unique finds that also have great prices!,2021-03-18 22:58:36,Veeamoni
1427,Good,False,5,"The app is good in my opinion. Maybe better than wish. So far, unlike with wish, I’ve been getting exactly what I’ve ordered. That’s a nice advantage over competition. Ali doesn’t really false advertise as far as I can tell. Prices are good the selection is pretty much endless. Lately for me it’s been a wonderful place to get phone cases that actually look like the picture.",2021-02-05 03:29:55,kitty9630
1428,Dishonest sellers,False,1,"You can find some good bargains on many varieties. Good buyer protection policy but the response time is a week- 10 days drag to month. I have to file fraud transactions with my credit cards to get refund. Some took over three months for delivery. I have sellers ask for extra money for shipping. Stay away from electronic stuff, Broken down fast. Some others never make it and i have had to waste time to file dispute. Use it but beware. I hope somehow Aliexpress can remove the dishonest sellers to protect majority of the decent vendors. Why are there so many scammers as sellers allowed to be listed on the app?",2021-03-05 01:29:03,T3x@sss
1429,Great app,False,5,"I have great experience with this site 
Everything is good just the time sometimes long to arrive the package but no item had ever lost.
Just one bad seller, I sent the pictures of the items was small and tight then he answer me (it looks fine to me) I have never send pictures of myself to other people even though it was not a good experience",2021-01-22 06:06:02,Ruaa 86
1430,Everything is right here,False,5,"You can literally search for and buy just about anything here! 

I do wish that products were more easily searchable, and that tags were more accurate, and that you could apply more search filters for better results, but if you have time and are willing to Dig- there are some amazing items here both as a retailer and a consumer.

Usability is easy, though I recommend doing some research on “buying from alibaba & AliExpress” BEFORE making any purchases! 

REMEMBER!!! This is mostly, if not all, Chinese manufactured goods- governed by Chinese regulations, NOT U.S. regulations. So there are a ton of excellent sellers, and some not so great sellers- bc it basically is open marketplace. 

Think eBay with no rules and possible language barriers.",2020-08-18 21:01:30,jbullock6
1431,Shipping is the problem,False,4,"I love shopping on this app but if you don’t have patience or need your product now this is not the app for you. The shipping takes a very,very, very long time. But if you can prepare for the future on what you might need and give yourself at least a month you should be good. Also try not to order from 1 seller in small amounts the smaller the long it takes. But I love everything I have received just the time I get it isn’t right.",2020-09-23 18:43:40,Ladii Poca
1432,Amazing foreign app ever,False,5,"honestly i’ve been obsessed shopping here since the prices are absolutely incredible, they have something for everyone. i’ve shopping here 24\7. you don’t need a lot of money to shop since some stores have great deals to help out people that don’t usually shop. overall recommend to download and be careful to look at the reviews before you buy something.",2020-02-24 19:53:41,saucingonem
1433,Love it,False,5,"Makes it super easy to get the things I don’t have time to hit multiple stores to find. The items I purchase are the exact same items I would purchase in the US, but for a fraction of the price. Gotta be patient since shipping takes some time, but if you don’t mind the wait, you can get anything you want.  In my experience, totally reliable, and sellers are very good with customer service.",2019-04-05 23:55:26,Planet Lion

While I don’t have a lot of issues it’s worth mentioning that when you open a dispute you are no longer able to leave a review of a seller or product which isn’t fair.

If you’re not in a hurry for your items then it’s great place to shop but be aware that most items take 2 to sometimes 3 months to be delivered and I’ve had a few inexpensive items lost but aliexpress is good about refunds on Goods that are not delivered within your protection time.,2022-10-22 15:22:06,ahemitsaaliyah

1448,Amazing and has cool stuff,False,5,Sometimes the app has random stuff but to be honest it’s really worth it and when you think about it it’s not the app that scamming you it’s the buyer so when you buy something from the store you have to check the followers and everything to make sure it’s safe and to be honest I got all my packages and it was pretty amazing,2022-04-20 21:24:23,fefhcbehcheudheduhwf
1449,Pain in the neck trying to get help!!!,False,3,"I am satisfied with what products I have received. It is a pain in the neck trying to get help from support or to get a refund. If you order something that says ships from United States to United State, and 2-5 day delivery, do not expect to receive your package in 5 days maximum. It will still be shipped from China and the delivery time countdown doesn’t until your item is shipped, so if your item isn’t shipped for 14 days the seller is protected so the promise guarantees nothing.",2022-05-25 14:03:08,Stacy Caudill
1450,Wesley A.,False,5,Simple installation and setup. I actually recommended the site to friends snd even my sister. Friends more than family. But we all agree on one aspect regarding the shipping process and the time between the item being shipped until it is received leaves a lot to be hoped for! There’s has got to be a better way to handle the shipping in a quicker way!,2022-04-12 11:01:11,Chipchop1
1451,I love AliExpress,False,5,"I’ve been using AliExpress since 2018, it’s a really great app. But just like any other app… you have to pay attention to how many purchases, the ratings, the reviews and the photos with reviews ALL COMBINED. This will help you make the best purchases with the best vendors/sellers with great communication. Following those rules, I’ve never been disappointed with an order I’ve made!",2022-03-09 03:58:01,LunaGirl483
1452,Beware!! Use credit cards only!,False,1,"If your going to purchase stuff on this app or website please use a credit card only. Fraud protection is way better than if you use a debit card. My first purchase and many people I know who have used this site have had charges to their cards mysteriously appear after a purchase from here, it seems card info is being leaked. I have purchased on thousands of sites online and I have never had this problem until I decided to purchase from here for the first time. I do not recommend taking the risk buying from here.",2022-03-29 18:58:07,Lynn Woolwine
1453,Pleasantly surprised!,False,5,When I came across the app I must admit that I was looking for a catch somewhere because it could not be possible to get some of these products at such a low price! I have just received my order and it is of high quality and cost not even a quarter what they would ask for in the US so pinch me it is true this is a really good deal 😁,2022-02-02 02:12:04,littlekim666

1457,Search feature is terrible,False,2,"I know they could improve the search feature but as it stands if you type in something specific and use best match, even the first item is completely unrelated. It would also be great to search by price including shipping, and especially by seller rating. 

Also, [ebay should also take note] stop letting sellers list multiple prices on one listing to take advantage of the price filter. It’s an unethical business practice; it only frustrates buyers and causes us to distrust the store doing it.

And you can find things that you can’t find at stores.",2021-06-08 18:55:21,larsste
1459,Great app with great search criteria,False,4,"AliExpress provides you with affordable... everything. The only problem I find with buying off the app is that sellers have things listed that are out of stock and after you attempt to purchase that item, they message you that it’s out of stock and tell you to choose “other” as the reason for your cancellation and denies the cancellation if you don’t choose that reason.",2021-06-02 10:44:30,Terrybabii

1462,Love ittt,False,5,I absolutely love it since it has so many wonderful things. But the item does take forever to get here sometimes it is worthy the wait through. I spend all my money on this it’s so addicting I don’t know why. It’s okay tho because in the end it makes me happy.

1467,Tip: look at the amount of people who have bought it and look at the reviews,False,4,There are a lot of things on here that are resells or they just reposted the pictures of another company’s item so look to see if it is really what the pictures show or not. I like to buy the stuff that has the most sells because then you know that people are actually receiving a good product and aren’t getting scammed.,2021-01-04 23:52:05,Broken_Wraith

And this was a large, heavy purchase so I really expected it to be delayed but so happy it is here.   I’m also pleased that AliExpress doesn’t release my payment to the seller until there is confirmation that the purchase has been received intact.

1469,The Best Shopping App,False,5,"I’ve been shopping on AliExpress for several years now and I’m perfectly happy going here first to find items I need for crafting.  They have an endless supply of beautiful, quality items I need to make jewelry, cards and holiday decorations.  It’s extremely affordable and very easy to shop with many vendors in one place.

1470,AliExpress,False,1,AliExpress has a lot of really good items and products for reasonable prices but the shipping time fore every single item that I’ve ever purchased from AliExpress has been AWFULLY long even on items ordered before the covid19 pandemic. Every time I have ever purchased from this website my orders have always taken 2-3 months to be delivered to me. I’ve tried to contact sellers they never reply. I’ve tried to contact AliExpress and I still have yet to receive an answer or my items that I purchased 3 months ago. I would not recommend ANYONE to order from this website unless you are ok with waiting 3 months or more for a product.,2020-05-14 11:44:47,djack9898
1471,Preferred Company,False,5,"From my experience, I am happy with the items and service with AliExpress. I was a faithful customer of Wish, Geek, Cute, and Home but AliExpress experiences are honest and dependable. AliExpress gives the correct price when viewing an item and the price is not tripled when you get to the checkout like it is with other overseas companies that I have years of experience with. I highly recommend AliExpress to purchase from.",2020-05-07 21:32:26,Shani1969
1472,I can recommend the app,False,5,"I like the app. You can find here everything that you can possibly imagine. The protection plan makes it safe to order and really cares about customer’s satisfaction. The only thing that I find not useful it’s when notices that come to email address don’t have the picture of order and when you tap the link to the order it opens a browser, not the app.",2020-01-15 18:02:59,olena.mk
1473,"App is great, would change some elements of the UI",False,4,"The app has always served its purpose, didn’t have any issues using it so far after 4 months. The products ordered from here have always arrived reliably. The only thing I think can be improved is the User Interface or layout. I think it can be more intuitive...you’ll get used to it after playing around though. But accessing certain pages can be designed in an more apparent manner.",2020-04-21 14:51:14,selen43
1474,Amazing,False,5,"This app is amazing for many reasons. For one everything is cheeped than normal websites and you can find just about anything. I got AirPod super copy and I’ve had them for months with no problem and some people may say things for $0.03 is fake but its actually not. Just a quick tip don’t buy something that doesn’t have 4.6 star or higher In reviews and look at costumer photos, don’t trust the  companies.",2020-01-11 18:23:04,the ultumate one

1476,Distribution or free return,False,4,"When you get an item that doesn’t meet satisfaction or is not safe or the wrong size a partial reimbursement for the amount doesn’t work for me. I want a full refund for items esp clothing that doesn’t meet the advertised product. 
Great prices and I love it almost all of the time but when I went to return something and the shipping was just about the same price as the order I thought, hmmm; they need a product distribution in the States or free returns.",2019-12-29 05:50:44,lavagirlfirebabe
1477,Scammers,False,1,I never can see my messages nor has my orders been shipped. I have been waiting on an items for over three months when I finally asked for a refund . Ali express has locked me out of me out of my account ! They have not refunded my money nor have I received my items in which. They are still sending me messages to a soo called bad account. But my account was just fine before I asked for refund. They said they shipped it which it has not been shipped . The timing for shipping has been exceeded and now they are not letting me into my account and they are trying to force me to make a new one!!! They steal your money very bad experience.,2019-11-02 15:02:51,say no to these scammers

Their customer service thought I was lying when I sent pictures and thought it wasn’t a first purchase.

 If you would like the $2 off, use the app to create your profile and order (: although it’s only $2, don’t promise your customer something and it not follow through. Also, your app did not recognize my new account created on your website.",2019-09-16 13:17:59,Jobreeeezy
1479,Amazing company,False,5,I have ordered things from so many places in my 71 years of life and this so far is the most accurate of what they described and the speed at which is delivered is amazing and the quality I cannot say enough and I cannot think the company enough I will not shop anywhere else from now on it is definitely worth it❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️Willow 88,2022-11-19 01:11:50,Willow 88888
1480,Improved methods.,False,5,"AliExpress hold their vendors to the highest standard. I found them to be very fair and swift with action when you have ordered an item and it doesn’t look like it’s supposed to. Just with any other market place. Do your research before purchasing but if things don’t go as planned, AliExpress are very thorough to make sure everything goes well.",2022-11-09 02:57:09,Heelsandstandards
1481,Safe Shopping,False,5,I’ve been ordering items from AliExpress for many years. I’ve gotten many quality items at good prices. Like everything else their prices have gone up but not unreasonably so. Their shoes for the most part have been of fantastic quality and different than American styles. I’m always asked where I get them.,2022-10-24 13:59:35,gailrgkd
1482,Great and diverse !!,False,4,".. the only thing I would suggest allow to see the value of your purchase in real time as you are selecting more than one item so you know exactly the total and have to wait to the checkout 
Also be able to select in one purchase different items at the same time from the same 

Good products overall, different and very creative. Love Aliexpress!!! Thank you 😎😍",2022-11-05 14:58:00,EmiliaLoveLove

Not like Wish where the item is not what it seems to be in the photo.",2022-08-31 13:11:50,Reformed Skeptic
1484,3/5 customer service needs improvement,False,2,I would say there are great sellers but for the ones that don’t care if the item makes it to your door or not is a lack of service from the seller and the entire app. There’s no guarantee that they’ll give you your money back if things get lost in post office or if stolen before getting to your door so that makes the entire experience extremely risky because they do not refund your money. This needs improvement and there should be someone you could call.,2022-09-12 10:52:08,mizukistar
1485,‼️ DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING ‼️,False,5,"I love this app with a passion and I buy lots of great quality items on here for cheap. The catch is that there are lots of scam and low quality items so you have to definitely look through the reviews carefully before buying. Furthermore shipping usually takes a long time (usually 1 week - 2 months), but it’s definitely worth it.",2022-08-09 01:56:38,All the memes 👌
1486,Useful App for Purchases,False,5,"App is great for making household and electronics purchases. Shipping has improved and is faster in the last 6 months than in the last 2 years. I read the reviews before purchasing anything which helps with sizes, which run small for clothes and shoes for American sizes. Overall great saving and you get a lot for your buck!",2022-04-10 00:19:16,CS 823
1487,So much stuff,False,4,I find the quality to be better than wish on a lot of the things I’ve ordered. One drawback is the app is hard to navigate because it’s so busy. Just a lot of stuff going on and the communications are confusing. But I have bought many things from here. Shipping times are similar to wish but some things seem to get here much faster. Overall happy customer,2022-04-17 22:10:39,jbmorrison13
1488,I LOVE IT,False,5,"I love the lashes they sell, definitely the same or better quality than high end ones. I've seen lash companies try to sell the ones they sell here (which are like $3) for $20 on instagram, and some companies even block me because I comment about it on their pictures. They have really good prices, but be sure to check reviews and ratings",2022-03-02 03:52:02,AdriAviles
1489,Lace Front Wig,False,5,My New Lace Front Wig came in today.. Very fast shipping and the wig was true to length and the sellers  communication was excellent. I ordered an 18inch Water Wave 150% Density Highlight Honey Blonde Lace front wig. I ordered it on September 28th and it came today on October 4th. This Wig is giving me Beyoncé vibes so I am naming her Beyoncé and is part of my wig collection for this Fall Szn. I will be ordering from this company again soon and I am very much satisfied 100%.,2021-10-04 18:50:27,ExoticBee
1490,Trash,False,1,Everything is trash. Takes too long to ship and y’all tracking is a hot mess. Says a day and I might get it way before or something. Don’t order no clothes off here everything is small. I guess Asian sizes. When it’s 5x really about 2 or 3x. And y’all prices are all fake. See a picture of something that looks interesting and see okay price is low I might get this. Click on it and it’s the prices for something else that trash and the real price for something you  might want is 3 to 4 times higher. Just false information all over. Don’t believe nothing what the price is.,2021-11-16 01:57:10,King_Steven
1491,Don’t be afraid...,False,5,I was afraid of using this app/site before I tried it. I thought it might be a scam because some of the prices and availability of items was to good to be true. And I thought if it was legit it would take so long to get something. It’s totally legit and the shipping is okay. It might take 2-4 weeks to get what you bought. I highly recommend buying on here.,2021-10-03 07:48:06,Heritick
1492,Fixed the bug!! UPDATE!! GOOD NOW 5stars now!,False,5,"I updated the app thinking that this was going to resolve the issue but, IT DIDN’T ..

1494,Very Bad application for shopping,False,1,"There is no trusted in shipping tracking, date of arrival is changing when you buy the item, you need to wait more than 2.5 months to receive your shipment, you can’t cancel your order once you pay, they can’t help you by anything just you need to wait until receive your item, when don’t know , how don’t know , customer service they are not professional in reply and don’t solve any issue , I don’t recommend or advice for shopping  if you want to receive your shipment before your die don’t wast your time , really headaches",2021-08-17 11:14:52,classic1982
1495,Very satisfied,False,5,"I have been ordering from AliExpress for about3 years now. I am always excited to see what’s available. I think the prices are fairly reasonable. The vendors are not always the best, but AliExpress gives them their moment to shine, it’s up to them to seize it. I have been disappointed, a time or two, with the vendor, but I am very satisfied with AliExpress. Keep up the good work 👍🏾",2021-03-18 17:01:42,tgreene312
1496,DO NOT BUY from this app!!!,False,1,"This app is a scam!!! Don’t buy anything from it!!! I have purchased on this app a couple times because of the price. Product descriptions are often misleading, and you are not getting what you expected. However, what I cannot stand the most is that they don’t have any customer protection once something goes wrong. I had situations where I did not received the package, or I received the wrong item. But both cases, the seller refuse to give me refund, and AliExpress support favors seller when they handle disputes. Neither cases I received my money back. Spend you money elsewhere!!!",2021-04-30 11:53:53,xyy469933
1497,Merchandise,False,5,"I have ordered MANY items from your merchants. Over all they are quite nice and quality products.  I have run into very few who are not supportive or give a nice product.

Especially because our mascot from University I attended is a Duck. Contacts container has a duct . I was such a knucklehead. Thank you so much. Please forgive my attitude. Many sellers have ripped me off and I thought the worst. Again I apologize. Take care and be safe.,2021-01-04 05:54:25,Leenee56
1501,Customer service will not help you,False,1,"Horrible customer service, once you paid for something, even if they sent you wrong stuff it is impossible to get your money back. Customer service waists your time and gives standard useless answers without solving your issues. Self service is stupid and illogical. Most of time you can find the same item on eBay for cheaper or the same price and shipping would be the way faster. I would not recommend this online store to anyone. Once again, if seller sent you a wrong item, you won’t get you money back",2021-01-26 20:41:42,Colonel Jr.
1502,Love this app,False,5,"A lot of people try to down play AliExpress but all you hair to do is pay attention to the reviews, ratings and how fast shipping is.

What a great way to connect people from all over and buy great products at amazing prices...well the majority of the time!

1505,"App is fine, AliExpress payments are awful",False,5,"The app works great. I had a horrible time “authenticating” my account after a shipment didn’t arrive. It never arrived at all, and when I opened a dispute, I was blacklisted. After I authenticated my account by uploading my ID, I ran into problems using my credit card. It finally works, but it was a headache. Just make sure your credit card and account name exactly match.",2020-05-09 07:24:31,DaddyBoomalati
1506,"Beware, this application spy’s on your clipboard.",False,1,"I used to love Aliexpress for shopping! But with a recent turn of events (suddenly requiring a copy of my passport/drivers license as well as a photo of my debit/credit card) to make a purchase after years of purchases, I’ve opted to no longer use their service.

In addition, a rather interesting Reddit post touched on the face that Aliexpress is one of the many apps viewing and sourcing data from your clipboard. There are loads of other websites to use that don’t require access to this type of data. Or, if you’re that hardcore into aliexpress, I would use it with a private browser on a PC.",2020-10-19 21:22:03,I'veeliminatedallzejuice
1507,Complete Waste of Time and Money!,False,1,"My boyfriend and I ordered MANY items in FEBRUARY it’s now JUNE 19th , and we have received only ONE PAIR OF JEANS, A CHEAP DRESS AND A SKIRT AND NOTHING ELSE!!!! Which sounds like a lot, but we ordered SEVERAL MORE ITEMS!!! We’ve paid for the items and so we have fulfilled our end of the deal! They have given no updates and no information about the orders. No communication via email except for one when we placed the order. So don’t waste your time even looking at the goods. The clothes were very cool looking The prices look good, but when you don’t get the merchandise, that’s not a savings!!!! Totally a theft ring on innocent people who are looking for fun things. RIPPED OFF AND ANGRY !!!!",2020-06-19 05:54:42,Rays Magic Girl
1508,Decent app for certain things,False,4,"Although it does take quite awhile to receive the items you order this app is pretty decent. 
Most of the products are basic or lower quality. I typically use the app to order silicone ear gauges or smoking paraphernalia. I don’t think I would use the app to ordering clothing, shoes or any jewelry that you want to be of higher quality.
I think the app overall is comparable to the wish app.",2020-05-11 20:31:04,lexx V
1509,Love it!,False,5,"I’ve been using AliExpress over 5 years!! I love it I always buy all kinds of items! I even purchased a handmade Quinceañera dress!! It took less than a week to arrive! There’s times items take over a month to arrive! You just need to look at reviews before purchasing! In the 5 years I’ve only had one item that never arrived and it was only a dollar item, I think they returned my money",2020-01-06 20:49:34,RCIMRM
1510,One of the best apps ever,False,5,I love this App but it Can be addictive lol. You do have to take your time to study it tho. Because 9 out of ten times the clothing item will NOT be even close to the quality and image in the picture. And the sizing WILL be off by 2 or 3 sizes. Therefore it is beneficial to read all reviews and find a way to learn about the item. Other than that it is fantastic and the part I love most is the free shipping.,2019-11-29 16:14:38,Gemming7
1511,Love this app,False,5,This is the only place I buy my diamond painting pictures now. They have unbelievably great prices on them and well worth an extra week or so wait! I’ve also purchased other items from this site and have only been disappointed once. I’ve purchased around 70 products and just one of those never showed up and I can’t get anyone to do anything about it,2019-11-22 15:44:29,unnonjalike
1512,Contact before order.,False,5,"It will make more sense to contact seller before paying for goods, many times I order after successful order seller will later message you to cancel the order because they are out of stocks and telling you to pick their own reason for the cancellation always annoying let’s have conversation with them before proceed to make payment.",2019-06-22 10:16:47,Neyo-Akosh
1513,Great for kawaii items,False,5,I love anything kawaii and Sanrio and this app offers so many rare and cute items in these categories at really affordable prices. Yes some items take a while but that depends individually on each shop...some items say delivery will take longer but arrive really fast and vice versa. So far I haven’t had any negative experiences and find this app to offer a bigger range of items than the Wish app.,2019-06-06 03:07:44,Vickycarino
1514,Stealing money from people,False,5,I gave this app one star because if you buy something on this app and the seller didn’t sent you anything you never get your money back and there is no person to talk with to solve this problem  I have been trying to find a way to contact AliExpress but it’s not possible so i will not buy anything from this app anymore if i doesn’t get my money back 🙃,2019-04-18 09:54:05,بشير البديري
1515,Hair,False,5,I bought some hair for the very first time and I was scare at first because I never bought hair own line so I said let me take a chance and when to the beauty shop she ask me where I get the hair from because its was some nice hair and she said it felt very expensive but I told her where I received it from and she was surprised so she said she going to check in too buying her some I love my hair and I will be buying me some more,2019-03-06 12:21:40,T.I. kiNg oF ThE SOuth
1516,❤️❤️❤️,False,5,I love this app. I wish I would have known about AliExpress before now. I ordered a few things already and received exactly what I needed. The sellers descriptions are very accurate. The only con is how long it takes to receive your items but they are being shipped from China and the amount of money i save it makes it worth the wait. Took about 3 weeks to get to NJ USA. I'll definitely be using the app again,2018-12-23 19:02:32,KujoBPK
1517,Bunch of THIEVES beware!!,False,1,"I have bought a lot of things when I receive they look horrible some of them I never received when I open a dispute they tell me it’s invalid sometimes they tell you need proof like what kinda proof if I don’t receive the item sellers are thieves AliExpress them are thieves don’t be fooled by these thieves 
We're really sorry for what happened and totally understand your feelings. As the shipping information indicates the package has been delivered and you didn't provide the valid evidence within the limit days, I am afraid the payment has to be released to the seller according to our rule. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. Have a nice day.",2019-02-25 05:03:17,princess WL
1518,MY FAVORITE PLACE TO SHOP!!!,False,5,"I absolutely love AliExpress. They have so many items I’m am obsessed with the website. I just can’t get enough. I tell everyone I know about this website and steer them away from the others ones(honestly). They have free shipping, great prices and most of the time the stuff comes fast. Recently the items have been coming faster than normal. I really love it. Keep up the good work you guys. Thank you!! 😘😘😍😍",2018-11-30 05:34:18,MrsVille

There are some items that I have only been able to find on this app that I haven't found on other shopping sites or apps😍🤗😄,2017-12-15 05:50:41,Trivia of the day family
1520,Very good shopping app!,False,5,"So far, all of my orders from AliExpress has been very good as is exactly what was shown to be on the store. Although the items may take a while to ship to you, I say it’s worth it for the low prices. The app itself is also very user friendly and easy to navigate. This app is my go-to shopping app and I highly recommend it!",2022-11-25 07:20:54,RacRodd
1521,Love Aliexpress,False,5,Been a buyer for years and I usually receive product. Out of the many years I have with Aliexpress I have only had 3 shipments not arrived and refund was issued. If it says ”made in China” on something in the store that I am thinking about getting in store I check Aliexpress for it. Often the waiting for shipment is worth it. I recommend Aliexpress to everyone.,2022-10-28 03:30:38,ibeda1
1522,Great app,False,5,I love this app you can generally find anything your looking for at a good price! The communication between you might have with a store or item is usually fast they get back to you so they can resolve the issue! The whole site just wants you happy and satisfied. It’s a wonderful site with great stores or venders you won’t find a better one!,2022-09-23 22:36:29,momtocrazy
1523,Everything else under the sun,False,4,"They have sooo much stuff.  If you want to consume as a consumer, they have your back. Lol. Some, many things at such a small, a fraction of the regular retail price. Obviously some may be generic but they still 100% serve their purpose.  
Searching and finding what you are looking for may take some time, if very specific but they have almost everything that can be purchased.",2022-10-23 22:53:55,dan from merica
1524,Amazing deals,False,5,"This is now my favorite app & im on it all the time. The best deals by far, way better than any other.

Literally the best shopping app",2022-08-12 20:38:45,omgitzuni
1525,One of my favorites suppliers!!!!,False,5,AliExpress is one of my favorite suppliers for my artisan handcrafts business and to buy personal stuff. The app works great and moves fast in my iPhone XR. I love how fast you can browse for products and checkout without any problems. I highly recommended if your looking to find something for your business or a nice gift for a special someone.,2022-08-01 15:56:09,Teacher Luli
1526,Amazing app ❣️,False,5,Everything I’ve order been true to pictures I’ve always am excited waiting for my items but the only down side is it kinda takes a long time maybe few weeks to a month comes individually wrapped not in one bulk order all different kinds of vendors all very helpful to communicate with I love love this app 🌺❣️,2022-04-29 21:30:05,RIAA$$
1527,READ BEFORE YOU REGRET,False,1,"Worst selling app so far, I wanted to delete my account since it won’t let me shop keep telling me to do random things anyway they won’t let me change my email, I signed in with my Own Email and somehow now I have a random weird email that isn’t even me, I reached out for help and they just keep telling me to do the same steps which in the end doesn’t even solve the problem I’m having, second is that this app seem stingy very suspicious about the products, wish it was easier to function since I had a lot of stuff on there that I wanted to buy",2022-07-30 10:29:42,Sowe☁️
1528,Great shopping,False,5,"This is a really good place to buy knives, I’ve spent almost $200 on one and there is no complaints. Your money is protected through pay pal plus AliExpress does not release your money until you confirm you received it. My first order I admit I was a little nervous because I spent about $120 but it went smooth with no problems. Thumbs up from me 👍!",2022-02-05 23:26:50,mtrrebel1
1529,Uygulama düzgün çalışıyor. Works well.,False,5,"Yaptığım alışverişler, küçük tutarla da olsa, evde çok önemli işleri / ihtiyaçları / tamirleri uygun fiyata halletmemi sağlıyor. Bazı cihazlarımı yedek parça ile tamir ederek, ekonomik açıdan hem kendime hem de ülkeme fayda yarattığını da söyleyebilirim. 

Although the shopping that I made are with low value; they allows me to handle very important tasks / needs / repair at home, even with small parts & amounts. I can also add that by repairing some of my devices with these spare parts, I do creates economic benefits to my self and to my country.",2021-09-28 13:17:04,Digitemp
1530,The good stuff,False,4,"This is one of my favorites places for shopping. Not big problems at all with sellers. They are willing to help and understanding. Products are good some excellent at the price of selling. Everything works fine and fits. You only have to verify your size and the charting they recommend. The thing is you have to wait almost a month to get your merchandise. So no hurry, always will come for sure.",2022-01-26 17:46:41,My Ecard
1531,Love this app!,False,5,"Been a huge fan of aliexpress for a long time! It’s perfect for finding little cha-chas and niknaks for many different things. Another feature I like are the customer reviews with pictures of the items. They seriously have anything you can imagine and If you don’t mind waiting a month for your goods, then this is the best priced app for you 💜",2021-08-12 22:12:34,nikky 💜
1532,Great!,False,5,"I’ve gotten so many items from here and haven’t had any issues so far, one product arrived late but that isn’t Aliexpress’s fault.

1535,Completely pleased,False,4,"The App is great and allows me to easily find and purchase unique items. The one thing I don’t like is that your order expires sometimes before you ever receive your item acting as though your purchase is completed when it’s not. I don’t consider my order complete until I actually receive my item. The App is easy to navigate, so overall I’d give it four stars.",2021-02-09 21:13:09,wGailey
1536,AliExpress,False,4,"I like to order from AliExpress, the products are good quality and clearly described as it is.  Be sure to read all details before placing an order.  Some pictures look bigger than actual size may be for a close up look.  Shipping does take longer but that is also written on the description.  I just wish shipping was a bit faster for me so I can do custom orders.  Overall satisfied.",2021-01-21 14:31:53,TrendMona
1537,Maybe it’s just me?,False,2,"I find myself having to constantly delete and reinstall the app. After maybe one use if I access it again it literally won’t respond to anything I touch. It just kinda stays there and it’s honestly infuriating. 

While I’m at it, a bunch of my items never arrived and it’s wayy past the expected date which is super neat and in no way super disappointing. My expectations were low but Jesus Christ. 

But I still love this app so I guess I’m not leaving. But for the love of god fix that technical issue it’s getting out of hand.",2020-12-09 03:18:31,isar.ai

Please don’t use Aliexpress. The vendors themselves can be very nice, but Aliexpress has the WORST customer service ever. Need help? Well I hope whatever you need help with can be answer with their very poorly made AI: Eva. Need to speak to a human? Too bad, no email, no phone number, no nothing. We’re you issued a refund and never got it? Too bad. Aliexpress will directly lie to you about issuing you a refund. They don’t care. You’ve been warned. Shop at your own risk!

1539,Scam,False,1,Most of the vendors on there are Scammers. When you pay for a hair and 2 weeks later they tell you that it out of stock and the only way you can get your money back is to do the disturb they way. That mean you have to lie so they don’t look bad. And if you don’t do what they say. They wouldn’t give you your money. This has happened to me so many times and I have try to get in touch with AliExpress and they have deleted they number and email. They only have the Robot and it doesn’t even respond to you at all. I have to call me bank and pay extra money to get my money back. Just because how you pick those vendors.,2020-10-22 03:07:39,wheres my Money.
1540,Shopping Experience,False,5,"I’ve been pleased with my experience. I’ve received one order in about 6 weeks. The company kept me informed all the way from gathering product, shipping product, product arriving in my country, and estimated times of arrival.

1541,I love this app,False,5,"Honestly I was a bit hesitant to use this app at first because most of the things I saw where extremely cheap, so I instantly shrugged it off then I saw something that really caught my eye and of course being impulsive I bought it. I kept checking on it and eventually forgot about it then when it came I was lost for words I had completely forgotten about it but it’s a reliable app truly.",2020-07-07 21:12:11,ᔕᑌᔕIE

I have no problems finding what I’m looking for and I have found a bunch of great things since I started using the app. I recommend downloading and using the app to save.

1549,10 years and counting,False,4,I’ve been using Ali for over ten years way before there was an app and banner ads on social media. This is a for sure a bit at ur own risk type of deal. However the risk have been worth it. I hit a few bumps here Nd there but over all satisfied with my purchases. Any issues I’ve had for sure were resolved. I recommend trying it out. I for sure encourage you to read all reviews as well. An informed buyer is always a smart one!,2019-08-17 13:18:38,Niya1234567890987654321
1550,Delivery status,False,3,"Overall this app is easy to use.  However, it would be helpful if the ship/delivery status can be improved by providing estimated expected arrival date bases on the current status.  Example:  If the current delivery status is at “Accepted by airline,” estimate day maybe 5 day to California

I recommend everyone to not buy stuff from here I rather order from wish then here. wish takes like 1 month and you get the order or refund is easy but here it take 3 months + and the refund process is barely possible or easy to do. Screw this app.,2019-05-27 16:28:38,VB626

1556,App is great,False,5,"The app is great always easy to use. Ive ordered several items and they came in exactly as advertised.

1564,Good and easy to use with 3D laser level,False,5,"The 3D laser level was easy to use with it’s self leveling for vertical and horizontal line projection. This makes aligning everything much easier. For future improvement, it would be great if the projection of the lines can be adjusted +/-45 degrees in both vertical and horizontal lines so it makes multiple rows or columns installation easier.",2021-10-24 21:05:01,Buggy Team
1565,Lots of good products,False,4,"I have been using Aliexpress from a long time. Always like their response and never had issues. But unfortunately recently having bad experience with their products. If no return label is given so how is this free return!!!You literally have to print it😐 and find item holder or parcel bag for returning purpose. Use sort of bag that is returnable.
Improve in communication would be more satisfactory.",2021-11-05 04:01:07,ABST3333
1566,Love this app!,False,5,I’m forever shopping on this app. You deft have to read carefully through the reviews. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing from a seller without reviews. Also communicate with the seller before purchasing that way if you don’t receive your items in a timely manner you can dispute and it’ll be a easier process.,2021-08-22 15:22:07,DimeAquilla
1567,Love this app,False,5,I have been shopping with AliExpress on and off for over 5 years. I use both the computer and the app. I love having the app and being able to browse whenever and wherever.

1568,Great Selection,False,5,"I love aliexpress. Prices are great but long wait time. Every once in a while I’ll order something and it will ship dupe fast . Also I’ve ordered prob about 50x and only 1 item was lost. If by some chance you don’t receive your item aliexpress will refund you, so overall I think it’s great, literally anything you need is available !",2021-07-01 05:39:48,Genny328
1569,Bought few items,False,5,I bought few items. They were great conditions that they are not broken or ripped clothes. I was very patient my packages will arrive to my home. It’s worth to wait when the item will arrive to your home. I love this app because they have so many things you could be interested to buy!,2021-02-14 01:08:34,Shortyjess235
1570,Good quality,False,4,"The shoes arrived in the expected timeframe. US buyers should order a size up! The #’s on the side of the shoe aren’t accurate if you care about such things but the shoe felt of very good quality.   The seller was very helpful, responsive, professional and timely. Will order again soon and expect another good experience.  

Half a star removed for running small and another half a star removed for inaccurate serial #.",2021-06-22 11:40:50,Bionic1969
1571,Use at your own risk.,False,1,"I don’t ever write reviews, like ever. I have ordered many times from this company, most have been great. However, my last two orders I have lost over $200 to the company. First order they denied my return request even though the items were faulty and the second return request, the package got lost in transit for over 2 months and I never received it. Even though they say they protect customers from faulty items and lost packages, they don’t. Use at your own risk and only if you’re willing to lose your money and not receive what you’re expecting.",2021-03-06 14:07:12,Marfug
1572,App a bit hard to navigate at times,False,4,The app seems a bit difficult to navigate at times I am not certain if it is the app or my unfamiliarity with the app also the description of the item makes me hesitate on looking further at items I also am not particularly fond of having tools mixed in with personal grooming or Clothing products on the same page these or minor inconveniences at timed,2021-03-03 02:42:18,MFB ebsy search
1573,I like the overall idea behind the app.,False,5,"I think customer service is absolutely lacking and it diminishes the credibility of the site. I used to make a quick connection with someone but now this option is buried under “millions” clicks and typing.

Extremely weak customer service. I have purchased items never delivered but marked as delivered.

Still not satisfied with customer service.",2020-11-17 04:07:56,ooouuuiiioooiii
1574,Shipping !,False,2,"I ordered a small simple item that was supposed to arrive in October and just today, after two additional months, it arrives. Customers should not be required to wait this long.
In addition, while checking the status of said order, inaccurate information is posted. As of right now, the item I just received is showing that it was shipped from country of origin, but has not arrived to the destination country. Total lack of important information to keep customer up to date.",2020-12-30 18:24:08,SeabeeMechanic
1575,Hopefully it work’s,False,5,I haven’t use it yet I told my daughter I was going to start to use it on her today the only part I don’t like is it’s small and there is no instructions on how to use it but I did contact the seller and he did explain to me but it should have had the instructions in there or on the box I want a big bottle next order so I won’t have to keep buying the little bottle,2020-06-17 14:35:43,syxx1980
1576,Great app,False,5,Really the only thing you have to complain about is shipping time but you are willing to wait for a cheaper package which is why you are probably using the app in the first place. If you have an item with a valid reason Ali is very kind and will refund you. Some stores themselves will even send out personalized messages. I love this app but buyer beware of certain items people sell.,2020-05-23 04:47:45,hazel112111
1577,My favorite App!,False,5,I love this app. I have bought from it multiple times and have been happy with what I received. You have to keep in mind that you are getting what you paid for so don’t expect something’s to be perfect when you paid only a couple dollars. The shipping time depends on the seller because some things come in fast but some take a long time. Would recommend!!,2019-11-29 20:45:47,xoxokw
1578,Hmm..,False,3,"Well at first i loved this app even though it takes a while for merchandise to arrive you can find everything you need here from medicine to electronics even to hand sanitizer. But lately all the alcohol, sanitizer products etc. are still low price but the shipping cost more than the product making it too much to purchase or they suddenly dont ship to the US. Go back to how you use to have the affordable pricing and lots of essentials available.  now its just ridiculous! and too much price gouging.. :(",2020-05-04 01:44:25,Ms_Kloey
1579,I just love shopping on AliExpress!,False,5,"I love this sight so much I get all of my clothes from here.

1580,Good Experience,False,5,I expected problems after reading reviews but I have had only a few minor inconveniences using this in the cart unselecting while it refreshes to find more options...you have to get used to how this store/app works but overall a great option for those who are patient to get the deals and can live without fast prime shipping for a few weeks or months.,2019-10-29 23:31:05,nycomputertech
1581,Great app for business,False,5,The products are good and they have good prices too. Most often the sizes are not accurate so that scares me to buy more expensive things because I don’t want to go through the long process of sending the item back and waiting for my refund. More also it takes mostly 3 weeks and more for my items to be delivered. But besides that I like AliExpress,2019-09-23 03:01:28,blessed beyond a curse
1582,Never Crashes,False,5,"As an app, it’s really stable, I think it’s the only app on my phone that has never crashed. As a buyer/seller platform it’s amazing. There’s no reason to get scammed as long as you use common sense and read reviews/talk to the sellers. They’re really nice and all you have to do to change something is message them before your thing ships and they’ll respond within 12 hours usually.",2019-09-14 18:56:26,😁😁😁😁😁😁😁✌🏾️
1583,I love Alliexpress💕🌞,False,5,I love using this site. Great discounts. The daily games and freebies are awesome too. I apply daily and usually get something every few months.

Fabulous prices with easy to check reviews to verify quality.,2019-08-20 02:32:49,sggyhjkfrehbjiv
1584,Always helpful,False,5,"I’ve purchased numerous items with excellent success. However, with that said,  I’ve also had some purchased items not arrive but AliExpress has always assist with issues surrounding not receiving order but also if my purchases were not accurately described. Most Sellers are very good at answering questions and I think that some of the inaccuracies with descriptions is partly language barriers.",2019-07-06 17:55:22,Easton's Awah
1585,Love this app!,False,5,I’ve had this app for about two months and have found so many items for such good prices with amazing quality.

1587,Ali Express!!!,False,5,"I love this app!! I use it to shop all the time!! As a full time freelance makeup artist, I always find myself needing tools and supplies that are SO much more affordable on Ali Express! It’s unbelievable how much of a price difference there is!! Also the app divides with categories so it’s easy to navigate and go directly down to what your searching for. Reviews are up along with photos as well so there’s no second guessing. I love it!!",2019-06-07 01:58:19,SamihaGlam
1588,Great app,False,5,Great app good information wish there was a little better information or easier way to track because it doesn’t give you an accurate up-to-date information on where the item is or a more smooth way to communicate with the seller so that could be improved. But overall very happy and I will continue to shop on this app and Alibaba.,2019-06-05 03:19:06,Mexicanlad
1589,Great first buying experience!,False,5,"I just received my first item from my first order from AliExpress. I could be happier, the item I ordered is a brand not available elsewhere and it arrived in great condition less than 10 days from when I ordered it. Considering that it was shipped from overseas to my location, that’s pretty good, and was well within the estimated arrival date. Will definitely buy again.",2019-05-18 18:58:45,WinsAllot
1590,Nice app works good and great deals!!,False,5,"The app works and you can see and modify your order both on your device and through the website. However finalizing the order on the app gives you a few more cents off of each item!!!

I also like the options for feedback and rating items once you get them. I just found this feature today.",2019-03-03 16:47:04,risapod
1591,Awesome website,False,5,"I love this website, I can find whatever I want, the only issue for me is the waiting time for the product to be shipped and the waiting time for the product to be delivered, of course not on all of them, but on some, overall some products are very accurate, better than USA, and some are so so same like here, however this website is very good until now.",2019-01-17 00:49:41,F@usto0215@
1592,This app quite very good but do not expect the price is low,False,5,"About shipping, the site has a variety of products from A to Z but the price quite high compare to the other platform. As well as about shipping fee, I live in Cambodia the shipping fee like 4-5$ via Singapore post. The price equal to the one of the product but the delivery is fast, earlier than the schedule one week. Hope this you the idea for using this app.",2018-11-19 05:56:44,LaughingKh
1593,Much better than WISH,False,5,"They actually offer free shipping here. I check feedback and ratings prior to purchasing from any seller. I’ve never been disappointed. Everything is reasonably priced. Even if you do have to pay for shipping, it’s extremely cheap. Sometimes stuff takes 30 days to be delivered but in those cases, just make sure you order long before you need it.",2018-07-15 05:33:13,Ashley K. T.
1594,Good service from most sellers,False,5,Most sellers were very courteous and sent the merchandise was sent promptly. One seller was rude in answering my message. I questioned his cancellation off my order for non payment. I asked why he did not follow the information from AliExpress that when I acknowledge receipt of goods Ali paid him. He informed me that I was wrong. I will not knowingly order goods from that seller. My chat with your representative was patient and helpful.,2018-07-09 22:10:05,PLSOLOMON
1595,Great app,False,5,"Really great mobile version of the website. Easy to figure out and a pleasure to work with. Never freezes, I have never experienced glitches with it. Extremely user friendly interface.

1596,Great Deal,False,5,I bought the black circle smartwatch and it is a great deal. The seller sent the smwatch very fast and I was pleased to find it already in my mail box. I charged the watch for over 24 hours and then proceeded to pair it with my Bluetooth. It works great and easy to set up. I have no problems with my purchase and would buy again. Thanks 😘,2022-10-12 05:24:17,Dawn G
1597,Customer service,False,4,"I’ve been shopping on this site over eight years and I’ve only had approximately four issues and unfortunately there is absolutely no customer service representatives the most I have ever gotten is a robot response and not had my issues resolved!! It is my only complaint with this site but it’s a big and important complaint, I have lost money because of it !!!",2022-12-04 23:03:28,funkandgroovin
1598,So Far So Good …I’m Happy,False,5,I have ordered several items from AliExpress and everything has been shipped in a timely fashion and has come in packaged well and exactly what I ordered. I try to write reviews for most items especially when it comes to sizing to help others. I generally reference my own size so they can compare. I am happy with AliExpress so far.,2022-07-31 15:42:22,Designman6
1599,I’m impressed,False,4,"I’ve never been one to trust sites/apps like this…but I must say that I’m pleasantly surprised and impressed with it and the merchandise that I’ve received. The site is proving to be definitely better than “Wish”. I think the only negative is that the merchandisers would give better/truer to fit U.S. sizes. Some of us have bodybuilder-dad bods (I am one🙋🏾‍♂️) and sometimes your XXL is more like an XL, and XXXL is more like an XL sometimes a XXL, go figure 🤷🏽‍♂️",2022-07-19 23:10:29,emptypkts
1600,When looking for a product this site is my first choice!,False,5,"The site has many choices, great communication, and service.

1601,Great deals! Most that you won’t find in American retailers!,False,5,This is an awesome app for finding deals from overseas but getting your items after a couple of weeks at a way lower price than American prices! Plus almost everything I bought so far has been quality made and arrived faster than what they quoted! I love it!,2022-06-15 04:15:50,MexicalianMami
1602,Cheap for Bujo,False,5,I mostly just buy stationary and conventional jewelry on it and it’s worked out for me so far because I haven’t wanted or needed much more than that to be honest. I don’t buy clothes but I haven’t had any issues with the sellers and a lot of them are very good about contacting you ahead of time to cancel orders if they are unable to fulfill the order,2022-04-01 22:33:42,MarzMortal
1603,Love it!,False,4,"I honestly love this app so much. Everything is quick to ship and arrives in about a months time. Some seller’s aren’t as quick as the others, but most of them are good at what they do.

Definitely recommend this app.",2022-04-19 05:51:16,GC3D
1604,"Great App, spotty service and quality sellers",False,5,"Aliexpress used to be better. It used to be MUCH cheaper! So when you received wrong items or sizes, and had to eat the cost (very frequent) it averaged out. Now the prices are extremely high—higher than US based stores in many cases. So I don’t use it much anymore. But it’s easy to use, easy to order. Thanks.",2022-04-01 20:32:47,spiralsun1
1605,Love this app,False,5,I love this app a lot I used it for everything. It takes a little long bro man it’s worth it when it comes it. I know everything is replicas but that’s okay cause not everyone wants to pay for the real thing. I’ve got my friends using the app as well and they at least buy something everyday. Thanks for being such a awesome app!,2022-03-23 12:33:21,daddykcd

1607,Stef,False,4,Crazy low prices for REALLY top notch high quality products!!! I love everything I’ve ordered on this app so far!!💕 There really is only one small catch about why I presume the products are so cheap… It takes quite a bit of a WHILE to get delivered… a month tops😬 but it’s a price money savers like me are willing to pay especially when the products are 90% off compared to literally everywhere else😁,2022-01-05 08:10:55,Call_Me_Tiff
1608,Amazing prices & quality.,False,5,Why purchase from a retailer for the same items at a fraction of the cost? This is a great site with access to many direct to manufacturer pricing. Only until after the caronavirus is under control. None of the vendors I purchase from are shipping now and I have many purchases that are about to expire.,2021-10-27 22:53:37,MYERERNS
1609,Pretty good shops,False,4,Lots of inexpensive little clothes gadgets and jewelry. Shipping normally is lengthy but not too bad for my taste. Sellers are usually nice but some will straight up scam you. If you’re asked to wait longer and you time is running out BE CAREFUL! Some sellers got me a few times. I waited longer for my stuff and it never came. It was just enough time for me to be unable to open a dispute and get a refund. Hope this helps new shoppers :),2021-10-28 16:28:04,nshsnsush
1610,Good prices,False,5,"The prices for AliExpress are really good. I have always gotten my products quickly and the sellers on this app are always willing to work with you.

Then the watches were not working with US sim cards and the time was not allowed to set. So, really could not even use as a watch. Decided to return and, I insisted to send to US address as that was my choice. After many back and forth messages, the customer service decided in favor of not responding seller. I did not even get the cost of watches. Do not trust sellers options and expect the customer service will not be in your favor. I am going to delete this app.",2021-10-26 22:23:13,Brusk82
1612,AliExpress,False,5,"I have used AliExpress for many many years I have very much enjoyed it, my only complaint would be lately they give you one price and then after you look at it it’s a different price that I do not like.

1613,Price is right,False,5,I enjoy this apps. I can find what I need. However I wish shipping was more speedy. Maybe you can add the shipping price in the product or find more ways to ship by UPS. You think you found a bargain and then you hit with shipping cause. I know you lose a lot of customer when the shipping is calculated at the end Free shipping more customer,2021-08-08 12:54:27,Proudgeri

1615,I like it but it could be better,False,4,Some sellers are complete BULL but I have more positive things to say about the app then negative. Sometimes you get what you pay for with a bit of patience and sometimes you don’t get it at all you may get a refund if you are dealing with a good seller some sellers are phonies and liars but if you check your reviews sells and ratings you’ll be able to determine if it’s worth buying.,2021-07-03 03:19:53,Drebaebee
1616,You should get the app.,False,5,I’ve ordered many things on this app and I’ve never had an issue.

I mean considering most items are ridiculously cheap, I wouldn’t expect them to be high quality. This app is definitely not for impatient people or people who complain about shipping fees.

1621,Does what it’s supposed to do.,False,5,If you are familiar with AliExpress then this app does what you would expect. Easy to search and purchase stuff. If you haven’t purchased through AliExpress make sure you read reviews on the product and seller.

1623,AliExpress,False,4,"This app is my go to app when I’m having a crisis when it comes to my style, they have plenty of clothes that are super nice but the reason why I gave it a 4 is because some of the items you buy doesn’t look like the photo. Please look at reviews and most definitely make sure the reviews have photos so you can kind of get a hint on how it looks, also shipping take ages so just be aware of that but literally it’s a really good un pricey app.",2020-11-04 17:18:07,Urs a good game to plat

1626,Very good quality,False,5,The masks fit perfectly fine and do what they are supposed to do. They even have an adjustable metal piece that can fit the shape of your nose. The box had 50 and the quality seems good considering that they're disposable. came way more quickly than the original estimate date.

You might have to reconsider, since items are normally shipped from China. Keep in mind, I’m in the states and normally receive items about a month later. Also, if you decide to return things, you’ll be paying shipping costs. Good luck shopping.",2019-11-30 21:42:30,Diesel Draggon
1629,Cute top!,False,5,The top is really cute although it does run a bit small. I’m 5’1 weight 110 wear size 34B I usually wear US size  XS/ S and this barely fits my arms. So you can’t really move around in it too much. I would suggest you size up if you want it to fit a bit more closed from your chest and a bit more loose. Even though I would’ve liked it a bit more loose it still pretty cute on so that’s why I gave it 5 stars.,2019-07-02 02:55:15,Minnie Carr
1630,Great app with great features,False,5,Rarely would an app live up to its desktop counterpart but this one is far superior. The shop by picture feature has helped me find so many stylish things on the cheap. The community on here is also great as they leave detailed feedback to help you be more confident with your purchases. The app makes it so easy to upload pictures and leave feedback.,2019-05-01 02:58:50,Tannathan
1631,Unreal!!,False,4,"Aliexpress customer service is absolutely horrible! I spent $50 on an item, waited for 2 months patiently, and never received the item! The seller checked tracking & said it was lost in the mail, that I should open a dispute so he/she could refund me...but aliexpress took over the dispute & said they won’t refund, that the dispute is invalid?! I am a diamond member, been shopping on ali for many years & this is the worst scenario! I don’t get my purchased item or money back!!! 🤬",2019-05-28 03:43:06,Zuuluub
1632,More lists would be nice!,False,5,"I love Aliexpress, i’ve gotten so much from here for so little. Any problem i have with products has been taken care of very quickly. Also a lot of things on I’ve seen on wish is cheaper on aliexpress. The only thing i wish was different is that I wish you could make more than ten lists on your wishlist, i do a lot of crafts so having different lists is nice.",2019-04-22 18:03:03,Kristaaaaa562
1633,I like this App. Just few bugs found for the past few years. :),False,5,"I like this App. Just few bugs found for the past few years. :)
Something it’s freezing and you can’t get coins in the app. Also, if you switch between purchase tab/page and previous page, it throws you back to the home page (happens rarely, but still an issue).",2019-03-11 00:10:19,BIOSKULL
1634,So far as expected,False,4,Purchased a few items off of Ali baba express somewhat satisfied. Looking forward to receiving the rest of my items. Always look at the U.S. reviews first before buying something. Most of the stuff I bought I enjoyed. Worse thing about this app or service is expect to wait about 2 months for some products or services. Other than that overall this app does people with time on there hands Justice.,2019-04-16 06:00:29,yjvthdkg
1635,Awesome App,False,5,"This app is great! It’s much easier to use than the mobile browser. The mobil browser does not hold your place once you have selected an item to view ( you will be placed at the beginning of your browsing), which is exhausting. 
The app allows me to easily track items and when I add items to the cart I usually purchase offered items based on my searches.",2018-11-05 02:43:18,Tassy Smith
1636,Love it but please fix the bag,False,5,"Love it but please fix the bag: when I delete something at my wish list, it jumps to the top of the list. Beside this, love you guys! I don't buy anywhere else. If you read the reviews and talk with the seller, you can buy stuff which are great quality and lower price ever. I buy 5 years almost and can tell you, most stores in USA selll exactly this goods here 3 or 5 time more expensive",2018-05-14 13:18:34,olesiasia
1637,it’s lit,False,4,"I love AliExpress. They have most things you can think of for very low prices. A lot of people have told me they have ordered off of AliExpress and the product was questionable. However, every time I’ve ordered from this app/site I’ve had no issues w/ quality of the item. It’s either a hit or miss with this site but I’ve always HIIIIT okeeeey. Most vendors are super communicative and have no problem with working through a solution w/ you. It’s worth the download tbh",2018-07-10 16:13:54,meldelmarr

Buttt.....,False,5,"this app is so amazing mostly just has like knock off things like fake light up yeezys and fake band tees and stuff you know ? and other merchandise but other than that i loveee it it kinda like a mobile china town , it has  everythinnggggggg!!

1639,"Cheap price,cheap value, forbidden review",False,1,"Most of the items i bought were as described. Those items look and work great for cheap values until they started to break apart. 

When you first leave a review, usually you’ll leave a good review because the product worked and looked great as described in the product description. 

When the product started to function poorly within a month, you would leave a bad review. AliExpress allows you to leave this first bad review. 

When the product stopped working completely a few weeks later, a total of 2-3 months since its arrival, you would leave another additional review. However, there’s no such option anymore. 

Think carefully before you buy. Keep in mind that most of the items only works up-to a few months of their arrival. 

I have one item that I ordered since October and now it is December already and this item still hasn’t arrived yet.

1647,GREAT SERVICE AND COMMUNICATIONS,False,5,I highly recommend ALI EX for quality luxury affordable items. I received all items in pristine condition. Absolutely gorgeous. The seller was quick responder and gracious with negotiating prices. I received these in about three weeks. A very quick turnaround given the nature of shipping during this pandemic. I am very happy with my purchase and I do recommend ALI EX for quality luxury items.,2022-08-18 07:29:26,RevDALH
1648,Very good app,False,5,Ali express it’s a very good app because I was able to track my package that I ordered easily and quickly. I can also order stuff on my phone rather than on my computer. They have a lot of items on their app for decent prices .The app also alert you to sales so you can scoop up the items quickly.,2022-07-19 05:13:05,zombieJess9000
1649,A lot more to buy,False,5,"Having fun window shopping. Has more interesting products to look at that I haven’t seen on any other app. The only problem is I don’t have enough money to buy them all, so for now I’ll just have look for more stuff I’d like to buy while I’m saving money for the things that’s already on my wishlist.",2022-05-24 20:51:16,Jassylei

1651,Be mindful,False,1,"Sellers DO NOT like to give refunds and get extremely upset when you request a refund for a item that isn’t what you thought; gets lost; etc. I bought two necklaces as a gift for my partner and the seller claimed to have shipped them when they never did & kept claiming they did, then proceeded to ask me to pay for the shipping so they can ship another out (they didn’t, what a surprise). Too many scammers on this app it’s ridiculous. Won’t be using this anymore. 
This app allows sellers to run rampant and you best pray to the gods that you actually get what you paid for.",2022-04-28 19:31:30,The InsanE Gam3r
1652,Better than Wish,False,5,"I love a good discount & a wide variety of items to choose from & this is the app! Unlike Wish where you have to really read the fine print to know what you’re getting, this app has sent items that are high quality, fairly priced & arrive quickly most of the time. I’m so happy I was referred!",2022-02-02 21:03:17,Lolylucy
1653,Obsessed,False,5,I started by buying only a couple of items and waited the long month before receiving the items. Upon arrival I was highly impressed! That was two years ago and I still have not been disappointed! You have to read sizes and always get a size up! Can’t beat some if the prices!,2021-11-15 22:19:27,the nonreader
1654,Excellent quality for an even more wonderful price,False,5,"Very inexpensive, excellent quality clothing, basically you are buying straight from the whole seller instead of the retailer. You see the same tops and bottoms on others websites and in stores. Shipping does take time but totally worth it, though Lately, shipping time is getting better",2021-10-27 01:03:32,Karenmariepeel
1655,The best IS AliExpress!,False,5,"Six years is how long I have been a loyal customer to AliExpress. The products are inexpensive and many of good quality. The customers are considered and appreciated by many vendors speaking as a customer (I’ve received many gifts small yet free!). I will remain to shop with them until given a reason not too, which they haven’t showed me yet.",2021-09-08 20:35:34,IG: Mrs.BaddieBaby
1656,Baby Sweatshirt — Fast; Great Quality,False,5,"Ordered a baby sweatshirt.  Was nervous ordering from overseas, but really happy.  Great quality.  Fabric was a silky cotton/rayon blend, almost like a light windbreaker.  Order arrived much quicker than I expected — maybe 30 days or less.  This item would be $40/$50 or more in the USA.  I am so glad I found it here.  Will definitely order from seller again.",2021-07-04 11:54:43,DimeForYourThoughts
1657,App,False,4,"There have been a lot of improvements in the app lately, and it’s getting easier to find stamps and dies. At this point, stores are going to have property label the subject (ie: flower, bear, dog, stars, etc) in order to search for the subject you want in order to get 5 stars. Also, when Ali Express ads show in my Wooden Block game, and I tap on the item I want to see, the app no longer takes me to item I tapped on.",2021-08-31 05:13:20,htabott
1658,Orders,False,4,"I’m a platinum member. All my orders were coming to me alright,then suddenly towards the end of 2019 I ordered for items which up to now are taking too long to come unlike before. When some of them come I find them not exactly what I ordered. I am really disappointed and beginning to get discouraged to continue ordering from AliExpress. Orders take too long to come and they are not accurate !",2021-07-07 11:41:07,Yalamuwa
1659,Horrible app and service.,False,1,They allow sellers to scam people with little recourse. If you have real issues and keep trying to talk to customer service they put you into a thing that says you get to message the expert team. Don’t let this fool you. They essentially now limit your messages to 60 characters to explain an issue and then your responses will be emails you cannot respond to. They effectively silence you and cut off your ability to talk to anyone or have any dialogue. Horrible company with horrible customer service. Stop paying for China stealing our intellectual property.,2021-07-07 00:43:44,David Mooch
1660,Great App,False,5,A friend told me about AliExpress however was not convinced how good it was. I finally downloaded app and proceeded to shop  I have found all kinds  of products I have wanted. Good for you and looks like it will be good for my pocketbook. I have been pleased with the products I have purchased from AliExpress.  I would recommend them to anyone wanting to save money,2021-06-30 22:30:50,Redkat2755
1661,review,False,5,"I enjoy shopping with Aliexpress so much it’s my go to shopping app, i really don’t mind on how shipping takes long, there are some stores that have very fast shipping. 

The only thing i don’t like is that they don’t have a contact email where you can directly email the customer care, i received 98% of everything i ordered on aliexpress",2021-05-16 03:45:09,Bobikingo
1662,AliExpress,False,5,"I love this online store SO much 🥺💕 I can buy almost anything on here for reasonable and even very cheap prices. I HIGHLY recommend this app!! The only thing is, some products or stores MIGHT be sketchy. So just look at reviews and look at the store website before you purchase anything. I have only had one issue so far! But overall, love it!!",2021-02-28 18:02:32,Bryannalinn_F.
1663,NOT A SCAM,False,5,100% money back guaranteed if seller doesn’t ship order! Obviously you would need to read description and make sure the seller is legit. I’ve had problems with shipping and items not arriving or some missing but it was always resolved and I always got my money back!! I love this app! And I am still buying from the sellers I found to trust!!,2021-01-18 00:10:21,Marcel8348
1664,A tad buggy and I’m sure it’s spying,False,4,But it’s functional and easier to navigate than the website on a mobile device. One annoyance is the acknowledgment of receipt of goods process. You have to log in an item and it kicks you back out to the sales section rather than keeping you in acknowledgment section. Wastes time when you have several items to check in.,2021-02-06 20:05:50,ItsElemental
1665,Great app...,False,5,I think it would be better when ordering clothes if they could be categorized my material and size...would make shopping and searching a lot easier for the buyer.  I have to click on the item and then open the description to see the sizes which is time consuming.  Other than that it’s great for me.,2021-01-17 00:20:24,Goldplankdesigns
1666,I Love buying on Aliexpress!,False,5,"I love shopping on Aliexpress! I have spent a lot of money on there. They are super helpful if you don’t receive your item from the occasional sellers with prompt refunds. They hold your payments until items arrives before paying sellers. If you have any issues, Aliexpress is there to help you! I just wish they had this same system in the USA!",2020-12-15 03:54:00,LindyDiddleToys
1667,Affordable,False,5,I look for multiple different price ranges for one item till I find the price that fits my budget. I’ve bought so many cute clothing from this app ans I have no intention on stoping. Something take longer than other to ship but the store owners will reach out or are quick to let you know updates on your orders. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. Don’t miss out on great deals.,2020-10-22 07:53:46,veronicamayv
1668,Refunds and returns,False,2,I ordered a wig and The one I got was not as describe I contacted seller I said filed a dispute the seller asked me to cancel my dispute that was the only way I could get my refund I have all the proof from text messages of me and messages that was sent from the seller I will stick to the product back to Ally express for my refund and when I contact them in regards to my refund they told me that is too late that I have 15 days to receive an order while I did everything within those 15 days and I still haven’t heard anything now I’m out of $72 that is the policy.,2020-11-25 03:01:26,money9750
1669,Pretty Good,False,5,I was hesitant to use this at first but say something I wanted at a decent price. I like this more then eBay and Wish. I have found products that I wanted on either eBay or wish cheaper on AliExpress. The shipping times vary by shop. Most of the time I get my AliExpress items before I get items from wish that were ordered before hand. Overall I like it. I will continue to use it.,2020-09-04 01:50:26,Ethreil
1670,Why am I taxed & Submit order without paying,False,3,"Why can’t I submit order without paying?  I buy large amounts at a time and seller gives further discounts. I was able to previously submit an order without paying and seller could Adjust amount then I pay. Now I cannot. 

I do not pay taxes. I am a wholesale business to retailers. Now I have to pay sales tax?  Why?  Aliexpress just started adding sales tax to everything I order. This is not right.  I have a resale tax license. Need ability to remove tax or edit.",2020-10-13 12:54:49,HouseofTAM
1671,Great App,False,5,"Yes the prices are amazing, but don’t forget you are getting what you paid for. that’s not to say that you’ll get crappy products but again, a lot of the items are not super pricey. and while that may be satisfying, you have to remember that the quality might not always be super top notch. But I love aliexpress, they get me right without me having to spend an arm and a leg in order to do so.",2020-08-16 13:56:42,T.C.03
1672,"Like EBay, but weirder. 🤷🏼‍♂️",False,5,"This is a great app, but unfortunately everything is from overseas and can take up to literally months to get to you. Sometimes high shipping prices. A lot of great deals if you need something that doesn’t have to be brand name. I’ve gotten a few good things from courteous sellers. Be careful of cheap knockoffs! China has the longest shipping times and the lowest quality, from my experience.",2020-07-29 18:42:01,TheTommyC
1673,AliExpress,False,5,"The app is easy to navigate. I love how the app suggests more items similar to what you’re looking at. Everything is very inexpensive and the quality on everything I’ve gotten so far has been good. I mostly buy jewelry. The items take a long time to come in because they ship from China, so be understanding of that before you buy. Shipping takes about a month or more.",2020-04-23 20:01:02,****molly****
1674,Overall a Happy Customer,False,4,I am able to find literally everything I could want on the app. The prices are cheap on just about everything. I’ve purchased anime themed room decor and accessories (DBZ & Studio Ghibli specifically) and have been thoroughly satisfied. The clothes are a hit or miss mainly in the sizes. Overall everything has taken about a month or more to ship but I’ve learned to deal with the wait since the product and shipping price are so low.,2020-06-12 20:03:46,JuBeeMariez
1675,AliExpress,False,4,"For the most part it’s an okay app, the issue is the shipping and tracking, or lack of tracking. The tracking is so terrible! Everything takes months to arrive, or at all. I had an order I placed the end of March (I know bad timing with COVID) but I got emails this week that say bad news your item did not arrive then they tell you to request a refund. I do that and now they’re telling me to wait another 10 days to see if it comes.",2020-06-11 01:11:21,Stecka31
1676,Love AliExpress,False,5,"Just as long as you’re a smart/mindful shopper, AliExpress is a great app to buy things. Shipping times vary and it does take a while to get your items, just be patient. AliExpress does a great job with their live chat - with any questions/concerns you ever have. I’ve never encountered a problem that wasn’t addressed/resolved tactically. Get this app if you like to shop for cute and useful items, and keep a lookout for sales!",2020-03-03 00:52:52,Jj_love421
1677,Delivery,False,3,Delivery is so slow but the product and prices are outstanding. I’m happy with the quality on how it looks on me. It all depends on your eyes how it will look. To me so far I have received one it looks great on me. There so soft that you forget you have them on. I can see very with them on. They stay on track with your eye movements on quality I give it a five star. The three star is delivery. It takes nearly a month and a half to arrive. Thank you for your service,2020-04-10 20:55:19,melbarules3
1678,Satisfied customer,False,5,You really have to READ the descriptions and follow size charts. Keep in mind you get what you pay for!! Look for other customer reviews and pictures to help make the decision. I’ve always had a good shopping experience but I am a level headed person and understand what I’m truly getting. I don’t expect name brand quality but I have found some really good things.,2019-11-10 15:22:22,Lizzybethcoots
1679,Best shopping app,False,5,"Before I place an order anywhere else I always search Aliexpress first. They have everything I need for a reasonable price. The only down side is that it takes about a month or more for items to arrive, but the good thing its that almost every seller offers free shipping. I recommend this app 100% if you don’t mind waiting a long time for your items.",2019-10-26 15:42:25,Keysi299
1680,Addictive ;),False,5,"This app is an amazing world by itself. My brother has recommended it for me and OMG! I’m just purchasing stuff for reasonable prices and free shipping. Thank you so much. I even have recommended this app to my friends. I hope AliExpress will add some regulation and punishment on fake stores, which deceive the customers. I hope adding a feature of sending complaints about unauthentic stores to stop their fraudulent activities.",2019-08-19 14:40:08,MsSalma

I spent a hour on a chat line with a computer. I’m very frustrated with that but that is my only really complaint. A couple of the sellers are buyer beware.,2019-08-28 19:04:33,scubacat14
1682,Reliable and easy to use,False,5,"AliExpress is a company that I had never heard of until a few months ago, but I’m glad I have their app. Their service is courteous, reliable, and I love the parcel tracking. They seem to understand that their customers like having as much information as possible on the status of an order. All of my orders have been delivered on time and in good condition.",2019-04-22 21:30:46,Bayleaf312
1683,It’s a scam,False,1,"Never ever think to download this app or think to make a purchase in it because if you do it will be the biggest mistake you gonna make. They will just get your money and keep you waiting for your package forever. And if you message them all they can say is “be patient” until weeks, months pass by and you gone out patient then you request for refund but the worst thing is you cannot make a refund because when you tried the “dispute” it doesn’t work. If I can put a screenshot on this review I will post my screenshots for you guys to see how they scamming people! This app should be reported and stopped!",2019-06-04 18:48:10,bradford45970
1684,My review for this site,False,3,I can’t give full credit to this site because not every seller on this webpage can have you received things that you order however some things you Order don’t come at all and some come before the delivery date I remember ordering two dresses months ago which indicate in the system that it was delivered but I never got it another one is my 3year old daughter coats i never received it for these reasons I advice new customer to be careful with the seller they order from.,2019-05-11 02:58:13,martee2015
1685,Great app,False,5,I love this app because there are many different stores and items. You can filter what you’re looking for. Choose items with free shipping or at a certain prize. You can also collect daily coins and trade them in for coupons. Able to apply for two freebies a day. Many items have good quality with cheap prices. This is the only shopping app I will use,2019-04-19 16:55:13,mosaid._

I was trying to dispute to get my refund from the seller but they said it was a shipping company s fault cause they lost my order, so the seller refuse to resend me another order and refuse to refund my money back. Then I was contact Aliexpress customer service but took them forever to responded my requested. I been waiting over 2 weeks now but nothing they do to help. If anyone want to order from Aliexpress think twice cause if the shipping company lost your package they will never want to refund your money!!!",2019-03-11 07:53:00,Pattyprems
1689,False shipping expectancy dates,False,3,The app has a poor satisfaction rating because they fail to show an accurate date on when to expect the order . The date will show feb 8th but it did not come until the 13th. I did not appreciate that because it was only made clear after it was too late and I already purchased it . It took too long for a refund so I would have time to purchase something else. So I was stuck hoping it would come on time . Please don’t do this to customers.,2019-02-21 03:20:24,Rosalynh33

OK I won some freebies it's awesome. But, then when I go to write my reviews it doesn't let you post it because you have to do exactly what they wanted you to do!! Really???? I tried several times.. Kept typing  and typing and bam sorry please follow the tips given. What? Really? This is crazy! I don't have that time! Why can't you just let us write freebies review and not take ridiculous pictures of the product! Eeee very frustrating. So just so you know I do want to leave a review but you won't let me.",2018-10-18 14:12:26,Summer7774
1692,Request for the next update,False,4,I really like shopping on AliExpress and also really really like the feature that we can track our packages in the app and see the entire process. The shipping takes about a month on average but the price makes it up. I have a request to add for next update is to have a feature on sharing our wishlists. It would be a lot easier if we can share our wishlists to others via url.,2018-10-16 21:11:53,Chana Winona
1693,AliExpress rating,False,5,It’s a very good app with a lot of deals for the fact everything is from china some things maybe made cheep but some things are really worth the money and your not going to pay a log so I’d say give it a try and once you make a new account you get 3 dollars off an 4 dollar purchase make sure to claim it,2022-09-19 11:01:09,lolyet69
1694,"Unfair & uncommunicative , no way to speak to a live person",False,1,"I’ve bought a lot of great items from here but I’ve also been unfairly treated by not being refunded for items I’ve purchased & not received like 4 orders that were in amount of $100+ that I’ve never been refunded for or received my product,no live representative to speak to , it was clear to see & track that items were not delivered, but it’s hard to argue with a bot ,so please be careful if buying from here, especially with money hard to come by these days , very untrustworthy & customers are not valued …",2022-10-15 05:39:50,GotRobbed Girl
1695,Great overall app,False,5,Been using it for about two years I can say that as long as you buy only from people have a good rating and also have sold items you will have the best experience I have loved the app ever since it’s a good experience browsing and buying just stray from sellers with no rating or items sold,2022-07-15 16:03:54,Alex.Dlc
1696,Cheap just a little slow,False,5,"It’s got tons of better deals with most of them being extremely accurate to the description. Just make sure to pay attention to reviews n stuff like normal. All the stuffs really cheap it just take a month or maybe two, so if you want things quickly don’t use Ali 💜",2022-07-02 00:57:04,ZaLyle
1697,I buy all my anime here SO WORTH IT !!,False,5,So far I've ordered on this app several times and im happy with the items i got. Some were pros and cons just depends on what you buy but so far im happy with it . I get all my Anime stuff on here & i 100% Recommend dont hesitate just buy lol . Also the shipping does take a while BUT it all depends on the seller but its all worth it from my opinion,2022-06-27 16:38:52,bellalove2698
1698,Amazing App,False,5,The app it’s self is very organized and easy to use I do enjoy the fact that everything is at a lower cost whereas you can find this at a different store and it’s very expensive but the quality of the items you get here it really just depends but so far I like the app it does take forever to get here but it’s worth it.,2022-06-07 20:03:06,Ramirezz.
1699,"Safe, and easy to use",False,5,"I like how I don’t have app glitches, and it’s quick and easy to navigate through and find exactly what I want using the picture search feature. Plus I get to communicate with the companies before ordering right through this app, to make sure they’re legit. That way everyone is happy.",2022-05-31 03:51:10,Shashe_james
1700,Very useful application.,False,5,I’ve been using it for over a year now and saw it steady but surely improving in usability and functionality. It is now my go to app for getting small items that I can wait. Shipment varies from seller to seller but they usually ship fast. Average delivery to USA is about 2-weeks. You can get really good deals though. Totally recommended.,2022-05-14 05:54:51,Russ12345671
1701,"Loveeeee this app, I’m so grateful for it",False,5,"I am so obsessed with this app, the variety it brings to your fingertips is crazy… Aliexpress has a me hooked, the exposure to various legit stores is so amazing, I’ve spent literally all on my savings on that app😭😭 After ordering over a hundred items, I even have 2 accounts, can’t wait to be recognized by them so I can influence for them🥺",2022-04-21 08:27:11,Melanin_yuwa
1702,Love this shopping app!!,False,5,"I have been using AliExpress for years and have always been satisfied. To have access to unique items from overseas is exciting. Yes, it will take a long time for some of your items to arrive but it’s worth the wait. The app is set up with easy instructions and plenty of opportunities to ask questions.",2022-04-11 14:07:57,Tyce47
1703,Addicting,False,5,I love this app very similar to Wish app but I’m a car guy and they have lots of car parts for cheap. You can find just about anything here. Shipping does usually take a month however since these items come directly from China. Great quality and great support. Safe to use as well they have money protection programs.,2021-12-12 21:28:43,Teenage Ricer 🚗💕
1704,Ali Express app,False,4,I do like to shop on this app……it is much more confusing than other apps. Not sure if it’s possible to make it easier to navigate. Maybe because too much going on. Although it has taken a very long time for most of my orders that I have through this app I have been pleased with the products so far. I will update my review if there is any further comments.,2022-02-01 16:54:49,didibling
1705,Love it,False,5,I love all the products I get from here. I always make sure to read reviews and try to leave reviews also to help other people. They have so many great products and good prices. I have never had any problems with shipping and if I have had to contact the sellers they have been helpful. Highly recommend this app,2021-12-02 00:49:07,Niki1718
1706,Love this app!,False,5,"If I want to buy something without spending too much money, this is the app to be. I can buy anything I want and within a month it’s in my hands.

1707,LOVE THIS APP,False,5,I cannot express how much I love this app. It sells things for cheap and the best quality too. It’s like YesStyle but the price is cheaper and are the same. First thought it was a scam but now I’ve ordered 3 times and all of them came. It does take a while to get to you depending where u live. for me it takes abt 2 weeks like shein time but overall u get the product!!,2021-08-29 00:40:23,krristea
1708,good items for good price,False,5,The trick to AliExpress is always reading reviews and checking the store out. If a shop’s item has less than 300 sells than its probably not the best idea to buy from them. The items can sometimes be cheap but honestly for the price of the item? You can’t complain. Its never hit or miss if you do your research! :),2021-03-05 02:04:44,laieyoon
1709,Obsessed with cuteness,False,4,"Honestly, all the little cute things on aliexpress for being such a cheap price. So addicting to see what I could get with the money. But, there's a long shipping wait and sometimes you'll have the seller's shipping method; you don't know when it's going to be shipped. I wish everything were to deliever on the same time. Personally, I have never experienced any scams or trouble with the seller.",2021-08-06 16:56:27,miyiee
1710,Ali app.,False,4,"Rating product is difficult as there are only specific questions you can answer. This does not work with all products or seller’s.
Please change penny auctions to items available. It’s quite a waste of time to only find out nothing is available or sold out constantly. Games are a nice try but far too slow for what ultimately has little reward.",2021-06-16 09:05:57,frutose the great
1711,Not real wholesale,False,2,"This app does not have real wholesale sellers. Any items that are “brand name” are NOT! A good example is the LIY fountain pens that range $91 or so retail. They do NOT sell through 3rd party, and yet there are several sellers claiming that is what they are “wholesale” with a price mark of $91. Wholesale price in ALWAYS under 50% of retail value. The more you buy the better the discount. Anyone saying electric hand fans at $11 each is whole is LYING to you. Do your research. This is NOT real wholesale. Neither is DHGATE or ALIBABA. There are no brand names, no real quality. This is dollar store merchandise at best.",2021-05-09 05:08:01,Streiga
1712,Customer service and quality,False,5,"I took a long time to get my wedding tiara. I knew it would take some time due to Covid-19. It was well worth the wait. The tiara is so gorgeous, I couldn’t believe the quality, especially, for the price. And customer service were very helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you, will order again from this company.",2021-02-13 15:55:02,jilleah
1713,Going downhill,False,3,I really loved this app until recently. I have several items ordered that I’m waiting to receive and suddenly they erased my account and said I’m a new user! I’ve tried every way I can to get my old account back and keep running into error messages that it can’t be found! Very unhappy right now!!! Only rating 3 stars so it will maybe show up to warn others! Hoping this review will get their attention and help me solve my issue!,2021-03-03 01:30:28,nicknames irritating also
1714,Reliable Service and Shipping,False,5,"I don’t remember ever having a problem with ordering from this app. I have always received my orders and I have never been disappointed.

1716,Late shipment,False,5,I just want you to know I received the items today only cause it went to wrong address please put bigger labels so post office don’t do these mistakes again I’m lucky I got it back this time but I still didn’t receive a lot of my shipment that I purchased before these items I’m very concerned I paid a lot of money and I’m a disabled old lady. Thank you very much God bless Always.,2020-12-03 03:05:22,lillian hanna
1717,AliExpress,False,5,I really love AliExpress the prices and the shipping has been very nice in my experience. I also enjoy the large variety of products. As for communication majority of the vender are very responsive some not so much but I feel that comes with having such a large variety of goods and vendors. I’ve been using this sight for years and don’t see me stopping any time soon. 🧡,2020-06-22 22:27:25,Go to site❗️
1718,Good Experience,False,5,"I appreciate AliExpress! You just have to heed ratings, make sure you look at review pictures, only purchase things that seem reputable (good rating, review photos that match descriptions, good seller rating). You do need patient for shipping but I have always received my goods. I have bought lots of great things from AliExpress and I’ve only been disappointed once with something I bought.",2020-04-16 13:30:30,imari_imari
1719,Great! Easy to Use,False,5,"This is why I’m broke! It’s the best way to buy my craft items like Washi tapes, craft supplies storage, and also nail art tools. Payment is quick and easy. Shipping is mostly 2 weeks or more from China. But, it all depends on the seller store’s shipping policy. Even air mail shipping  is cheap. There are multiple layers of coupons to get discounts on almost every item. The Aliexpress anniversary sale in March is the best!",2020-04-07 20:39:58,iphonecrazy
1720,Good Shopping Site,False,5,"I use this app and website more than other shopping sites. Not every site is perfect, so of course you need to be patient while sellers are trying to ship packages out. If I ever had a problem with my order I messaged the seller or the costumer support and we work things out. Many of the products I buy are usually gifts and my friends enjoy the quality.",2020-02-27 22:01:46,Jessica_Delia
1721,Not worth you’re time and money,False,1,"When I first got the app I was super excited to see the cheap deals but later did I find out that the shipping can get extremely expensive because almost all the items ship from China. It can also take months and months for items to get in the USA. Also their “coin games” were dumb. So you save coins by following shops and liking shops posts and other things, but it was dumb because of you had 20 coins it would tell you could get a coupon but then the coupon would disappear.

I wish I would received them sooner!! But since the price is very low, I really don’t mind waiting, it’s so exiting when you get them in the mail!!! You guys are soooo awesome!! Keep up the job!!

1725,Really Great App and Seller!,False,5,"The app is pretty user friendly! The buyer feedback is invaluable! There are a few kinks but I can definitely live with them. One of them is the cart limit, if you get too many items in the cart it seems perhaps you can no longer see them. None of this is a large problem except I don’t ever know how many items I have saved.",2019-12-09 10:51:41,JFrau
1726,Love it!!,False,5,i absolutely love using aliexpress the prices are great and the products are even better. one downside tho is that sometimes depending on the seller and location the items can take a lil bit to ship to you but it’s definitely worth the wait. it also helps if you read the reviews of the items (especially clothes) so that will help with your purchase,2019-11-25 20:56:17,💍💖•G I A N A•💖💍
1727,Simple. Easy to use. Love the discounts for using the app!,False,5,"I love this app but I have to delete it once I’ve received all of my items.

1728,My favorite place to shop,False,5,"Had many experiences on Wish that were horrible, generally due to intentionally deceptive descriptions of items, As well as Wish intentionally leaving off poor ratings and bad reviews.

Only problem is, I cannot imagine if I need to return (if the size runs too small or too large), where could I go? Background: most items shipped from China and it takes like 3-5 weeks, don’t know how exchange/return works. 

All in all, I think I got the $ worth it if I shop here.",2019-08-03 12:31:41,pusheenG
1731,Nice products for good prices,False,5,I purchase pretty regularly and haven’t had too many problems. You do have to be patient with the shipping tho. Some things come really fast and some things take between 1 & 2 months. I’ve only had one thing so far get lost. Refunds are kind of confusing but since I don’t buy expensive things it’s usually not worth the hassle.,2019-06-17 02:25:30,The Nail Artist

I tried to buy some bundles off of the app and they kept declining my card and nothing was wrong with the card or anything, I had the money. Then I tried again and when I went to go use my card somewhere else they declined AGAIN! Because they blocked it frm me using on the app trying to buy something. I apparently bought it frm london. Buh fun fact is..... the package was coming frm New Jersey sooooo. I was totallllyyyyy confused 🤷🏾‍♀️. Buh heyy still got my package and it came very FAST. So yea “EH”.",2019-07-29 15:24:49,Brii.2fdr

Ive ordered many times and on all my orders i have been happy. only one bad experience when i didnt recieve an order due to the seller, overall i got my money back.

Very happy customer !! 🤗",2019-04-23 07:22:32,casey73012
1734,Not worth the risk,False,5,I have ordered from AliExpress a couple of times for the most part it goes smooth but the last couple of times it’s been awful. Scammers give untraceable tracking numbers on top of that you have to battle with AliExpress to get your money back. I order something in December it’s now March and I’m having to wait another month to just get my money back. Im done with this app TOO MANY SCAMMERS ON HERE!!,2019-03-12 07:52:43,Fbomb96
1735,good stuff and great prices,False,5,"so easy to spend way too much time looking for, and finding SOOOO many different things. sometimes the quality of products is not the best but that’s the vendor, not AliExpress. those items that aren’t any good you can dispute and get refunds. vendors do not like bad reviews or disputes so they try to make things right. read reviews of the store too not just the products.",2019-03-05 02:49:09,HalleT_22

Can track orders; usually receive goods in 3-4 weeks to USA; sometimes less and never more. Has a “more you’ll love” section that is super relevant.

Lol duh!  Anyways they won’t give you a refund.  They will say they will if YOU pay for the shipping.  (After begging) Who knows if they even will give the refund.  I obviously couldn’t trust them to send me “authentic shoes”.  Ended up they said 8$ plus $15 then They said they wanted to talk.  Never talked! All I got is a $8 refund for $88 shoes I’m embarrassed to even give as a gift!  Not even worth my time! I’m not happy with this app and will not use it anymore.

1739,"App is okay, store is not",False,1,"I purchased a few items from the store. Keep in mind you are dealing with likely small businesses directly in China, so items are cheaper but you are not guaranteed to receive the item.

I ordered an item and it did not arrive within the prescribed time. They told me it would arrive and extended my “buyer protection” deadline. Buyer protection is a very short period of time where you can complain about whether or not the item was received or it had issues. In my case the item never arrived within the period. I went to disputed but they told me it’s too late to dispute. Avoid this company at all costs!",2018-09-12 17:43:48,ussherpress
1740,Borderline obsessed,False,5,Whenever I think of something I might like to have but am not in need of it ASAP I’ll search on this and 9 time out of 10 there are highly rated products for sometimes less than a dollar.

1741,Bad vendors bad service!,False,1,"Don’t buy from beautiful princess hair, lumiere hair or from beeos hair! All bad vendors with horrible products and block clients who complain about their falsely advertised human hair. AliExpress does nothing to fix the issues. There are a few good vendors with fast and accurate products but not worth it to download the app and sign up bc you can’t even delete it ever with sounds like a major privacy violation. Do yourself a favor and don’t download or use the app and don’t buy from vendors above esp beautiful princess hair because they will email other vendors and talk lies when you complain about their crappy hair. Don’t say I didn’t warn you",2018-09-06 16:06:14,Blkbarbiee

Ali has added a step to the shipping called at local office and it will list your city but it will not say delivered.

1745,Pretty decent shopping app.,False,4,I only take away a star bc of the wait time and because I’ve received a couple of items one was broken and the other was the incorrect size from what I’d ordered but I’ve only had two bad experiences out of the MANY things I’ve ordered that were satisfactory so that’s why my rating is what it is. There’s a wide selection of cute/cool things to buy so I love it. 💖,2022-11-01 13:16:04,Coripoo
1746,Fraud,False,1,Ordered multiple stuffs from Aliexpress and ALL of the tracking did not update. Went on to open dispute since my buyer’s protection plan was going to expire but the response I got was that I should be the one contact the shipping company. What a joke. I still went to the local post office and asked but the said they have nothing for me. So Aliexpress basically is saying that’s not their problem for not shipping me the products I paid for and they don’t care if it doesn’t arrive and the so called ‘buyer’s protection plan’ is a complete joke too. Fraud. Don’t spend even $1 on Aliexpress.,2022-10-04 04:23:43,bt100bt
1747,I love Ali,False,4,"However I feel as if they are too much, and just flexing on the products  bc it’ll show the picture and the amazing price, most times, free shipping.  Yet when you got to order it, turns out your getting one tiny thing that can really do anything for you or it becomes very a lot smaller than I assumed other ones fantastic I love it. Shipping is getting better every day..",2022-09-23 02:10:02,ashleebruno3
1748,Lots of bargains!!!,False,5,"Been shopping on here for awhile, items may take longer to arrive, but it’s free shipping so I don’t expect fast delivery.

I have proof of the deliveries to my mailbox that day and there were no deliveries. AliExpress refused to refund me. 
I have used this app for years and there is not a lot of consistency. Sometimes items take weeks and months to be delivered and other times days. 
I do not recommend spending more than a couple bucks at a time as there’s no guarantee you will get the product or your money back.",2022-08-25 00:06:16,Sleighther

1751,Would give -0⭐️ but that’s not an option!,False,1,"Pt 2 from last review… so I tried getting my refund doing it the way the site said to and it won’t even let me set a refund amount, idk if it’s to stop me from getting my refund but everytime I click the “please enter refund amount” it won’t let me type it, but for any other option like “delivery status” and “please select a reason”, I can perfectly answer and click it. Mind you, there’s absolutely nothing with my phone or screen, it’s not frozen. They are legit scammers and I want my money back on BOTH orders!",2022-07-14 07:10:11,durteduchess
1752,Another great product at great price.,False,5,I love buying things for way less even if I have to wait for a week or two to receive them. Lately the stuff I buy from this app seems to get to me within 2 weeks. It was taking sometimes 2 months or more but lately I get my orders really fast. So I like it even more rnhhfh,2021-12-23 22:19:33,thwzrd
1753,No Buyer Protection As Promised,False,1,AliExpress protects its sellers only and not the buyers. I purchased shoes for $81 that were incorrect and they only refunded me $10. I contacted the seller prior to opening a dispute and he only offered $10. Because he knew disputing it would be a waste of my time and not his! Don’t shop here. They claim to offer buyers protection and they absolutely don’t! I tried to leave a review on the sellers site and it’s no longer available under that name at least. It appears they have several sites under different names but same buying format. Beware of the VIP site with gold lettering.!,2022-06-20 09:22:37,AliExpress is a scam
1754,Worst Customer Services App Ever,False,1,"This app is scam. Customers wont be protected. They favor sellers. The sellers mostly provide you low quality products and warrantee. If you report them, you get nothing. I paid over $60 for a product, and could not get a refund (not even a penny)  even though I returned it. They said their reason was “return late!”.
Stupid policy, of course it was late, because when l contacted the seller and told them my tracking said my parcel was delivered, they took a week to inform the Ali people that they received it. Stupid order. Won’t recommend to anyone.",2022-05-31 13:28:53,Seeker Ravenclaw!
1755,Costumer service fraud and favor in seller,False,1,"If you haven’t download this app, please DO NOT download it. If you are using this app, one missing package will make you delete it. The way they handle a missing package is horrible. Keep customer waiting for 61 days and still refusing to issue a refund. Even tracking record shows package was stocked since Feb21, they still want the buyer to proof not receiving it. Treating customer like a theft. Customer service representative sending business fraud email to me and another representative telling me that solution is not what they really mean. Big joke!",2022-04-13 03:37:32,ShirleySun1113
1756,Has good sales and coupons. The app can be buggy. my order history jumps back to the top sometimes.,False,4,I love Ali but i always approach with caution. Buyer protection failed me once when a seller sent me different model radios and ali sided with them. I had to file a charge back to get my 70 back... They’ve always refunded me immediately when something doesn’t show up in time but they are grimy at times. FYI.,2022-02-19 02:01:45,Sevabeva
1757,Great prices for the  more for. Can find item from. Sometimesbut just order early.,False,5,"Great pricesFor the same merchandise others charge much more for, can find items not available through other retailers, so much to choose from, sometimes the wait is long but the prices make up for it just order early.",2021-11-04 22:36:23,andnndjxijenbjkkn
1758,You’ve got a 50/50 shot,False,2,"Sometimes you’ll get amazing quality things cheaply, other times you’ll never receive the package and they’ll still take your money anyway. Sometimes the pictures are accurate and of the product, other times it’ll be a badly made knockoff that you receive. Still, they’ll keep your money anyway. So be careful. The people at AliExpress don’t care about you or helping you, they just want your money and don’t care if you get what you ordered or not.",2021-12-02 20:05:26,djdlsibfhg
1759,Be careful,False,5,Great app. But you rarely win a dispute. So make sure you deal only with honest sellers. I lost a dispute over two eye lash curlers that didn’t put in the eyelash serum. I fought for months and lost. So be careful with beauty products. They are usually copies that aren’t real. But the clothes sellers are good. Just remember to order 2 to three sizes larger. Asian sizes are very small. But I have had fun with the clothes.,2021-10-28 05:02:45,mindi joy newman
1760,Excellent app!!!,False,5,I love shopping on this app because the sellers are very interactive with their customers and make sure your purchase/the customer is satisfied. It may take awhile to get to you but you’ll get it and I say this company is wayyy better than WISH! Lol trust me! You’ll love the variety of stuffs they have and the quality is awesome. You gotta shop on here!,2021-10-02 22:50:14,mixyblue
1761,Great app,False,5,"App is user friendly and even fun to use. If I could change one thing about the app, it would be to be able to make more than just a few wishlists. I have 5, I think, to keep things organized, but it won’t let me make more than that. Other than that, I love the app and find it very simple to use.",2021-07-01 16:47:16,agoldenbell
1762,Fair Prices,False,4,"Haven’t had a problem with an order yet and the prices are hard to beat for spare parts. There’s quite a collection to choose from. The reason for 4/5 stars is sometimes when your searching for a specific item you get a lot of unrelated items. Otherwise decent prices, though expect long wait times if you live far from China.",2021-08-12 20:18:11,BerserkNPotato
1763,Great app!,False,5,It’s a great app a couple of items can be a hit or miss but if you pay attention to orders they have sold of the item or even the reviews ( ones with pictures are a plus ) you should be great to order ! Compared to what we pay at other online stores AliExpress is a more convenient and easy on the pocket app!,2021-03-25 19:52:01,Richiee B

1766,Great products for a great price!,False,5,"I really enjoy shopping here. There are a number of items to chose from and the customer service is great. The only improvements will be the shipping. It can take several weeks for the items to arrive. If there is a problem, they will try to resolve it as soon as possible.",2020-12-19 14:41:54,A Pretty Kitty
1767,Wonderful Site,False,5,I have been buying from AliExpress for a few years now and I hate to say it but I buy a ton of stuff on here. It takes a bit to get but 90% of the time it is well worth it. They have different products that you will never find anyplace else and at a wonderful price. I will continue to shop and find outstanding products on this site,2020-08-17 21:17:31,L.A. Realtor
1768,Harassment,False,1,Now nana meetu has harassed me and won’t stop harassing me because she texted me through the chat and said we don’t have your item I said cancel order this is same day she then says could you go back and change your reason to why you’re canceling she said say you just don’t want it I said no thank you that’s lying now she won’t stop texting me in my chat box someone please tell me how to block her and how to report her for harassment I have all receipts this is the 6ixth time she’s texted me please help me somebody I sent every screenshot to my bank so they have proof of everything she’s saying so I can get a complete refund,2020-09-18 03:08:59,tboJry

I hardly ever shop online but I am addicted to buying things on here, and so far I haven’t had any trouble with this app. I’ve gotten everything I’ve paid for except a couple of things, but I’m sure it will come in it just takes a while. We have to be patient.",2020-07-25 01:51:43,jas1211
1770,Worse app,False,5,"Ok so every time I order from this company twice already, my orders get cancelled for no reason. My orders where paid in full after they got cancelled. So far besides my orders being cancelled, I still havnt got my money reimbursed for that cancelled order. On top of that they are still holding my payment. Very poor customer support as well.",2020-07-18 08:01:23,frontera1974
1771,Great fun,False,5,I love this app. If you have the patience and don’t need your item right away then this is the app for you. I have been purchasing for s few years now. Very seldom have I ran into an issue and there are a few bad apples in the bunch for customer service steps in and makes things right. You can choose to filter your items for free shipping. Try it. You’ll like it.,2020-06-25 07:01:58,34more
1772,Charise’s review,False,4,I really love shopping with AliExpress. There are a lot of great products on the site. Anytime I have a problem I know they will refund me my money quickly. Every since coronavirus all the items prices have gone up which is stop me from shopping as much. I hate the fact I only have so much time to review a item because by the time I finally wear the item I can’t upload the photo wearing the outfit with my hair and make up done.,2020-07-12 13:45:42,reeesey reese2020
1773,DONT PURCHASE FROM THIS APP! SCAM!,False,1,"I’ve been purchasing from Ali Express the past year now. However, over 10 different items I ordered back in March 2020 still hasn’t arrived and it’s July 2020! I don’t mind waiting that’s why I’ve always ordered certain items from them. But as of today, I currently have lots of items in dispute in an attempt to the try and get my money back. The companies know I never received my items and just mark the order as completed. Go shop online at regular stores, EBay or more reliable sources. Ali express isn’t worth the wait or the hassle of paying for items that never arrive.",2020-07-10 00:11:03,LadyKingdomKash
1774,New shoes,False,5,I purchased two pairs from this store. Both pair are very soft leather and comfy. The communication with Ada was excellent. You won’t find these at the local shoe store which makes for the uniqueness of ownership. The soles are soft rubber and probably won’t last that long if you plan on wearing everyday. Packaging was excellent and both pair arrived in perfect condition. Please don’t think twice about ordering from them.  Thank you Ada,2020-06-08 22:24:35,justsmie
1775,Best Way to Shop,False,5,"I’ve been using AliExpress for a very long time. It continues to make great improvements. The products are excellent with great prices and discounts. The shipping can be tracked, deliveries are faster, and AliExpress guarantees satisfaction. There are options to dispute and request refunds. The merchants’ communication has vastly improved.  These are the same products that are sold in many major outlets. It’s worth the wait.",2020-04-04 20:47:24,Becky Joe
1776,Shopping Haven,False,5,Love shopping on AliExpress. You must read the reviews and shop from stores that people have already bought from. Don’t be a guinea pig! Send messages if you’ve made an incorrect order or mistake   (communication is important). Keep in mind some items may take up to a month to deliver. These are my tips when it comes to shopping on this site and app.,2019-11-21 03:57:49,JustJessWells
1777,Love it!,False,4,"Although you have to pay close attention and read the reviews on the products before purchasing you really can’t go wrong with AliExpress. I’ve ordered a few things so far and sometimes they do take close to a month or more to arrive, for the price I really can’t complain. Most of the products are good quality and the sellers communicate pretty well. Thanks so much AliExpress! I’ll definitely be placing more orders.",2019-12-03 18:28:27,101queenb

1781,"Cool products, but dispute enforcement needed",False,3,"Hi! I’ve been ordering here for more than 6 years and it’s a hit or miss. One thing I’ve hated recently is that after placing a dispute and receive a resolution, Ali doesn’t not enforce that a seller refund the money. I have since mailed a defective product back and received zero cooperation from the seller and there’s no way for me to even have you all contact them after receiving a dispute judgment/resolution. 

Products are hit or miss so buyer beware! I’ve had more good purchases than bad though!",2019-04-16 03:52:48,ShesYourQueen2B
1782,Love this app !!,False,5,Things are so cheap & still pretty good if not great quality. I’m sure it really depends on what you purchase but the prices are so good if something is crap you don’t feel like a loser. Certain things take longer to ship than others so if you need something right away I wouldn’t purchase on AliExpress but if not go for it. Everything I’ve ordered always was packed exceptionally.,2019-03-17 17:39:31,Dollipop
1783,Blessed,False,5,I can truly say that the seller was able to keep me up on when and where my package was going to arrive. Also when I had an issue with Both carriers FedEx and post office they were able to look into the situation by making sure that I have or haven’t received my package from them. I can truly say that they are more concerned about their customers. ❤️❤️,2018-12-11 02:22:35,Ree Hayes
1784,Literally Best App Ever,False,5,"I’ve bought many things from Ali express including electronics, makeup, jewelry, clothes, formal gowns, cosplay and uniforms. I now only purchase from them because I always find the best deals.  By far the best app with the cheapest prices. The only downside is the long shipping from China but I’ve never had any issues.

I can not imagine how much money am saving thanking the right decision, thank you to the Seller’s!!!",2018-06-14 22:43:55,NellyM Ramirez
1786,Trash goods selling website,False,2,"I placed a dozen orders from this website, except one order never came, all the rest orders either came in defect or became trash after 3 times wear or play! For example, the bow came off the second time my daughters wear her shoes, which make her so embarrassing at school! The dress became rugged after the first time machine wash! The puzzles came in broken! The toy is apparently smaller size than the expection! In this way, the never-arrived order is the luckiest one because I got full refund. If they really want to do business, they got to sell products instead of trash!",2018-06-19 17:35:38,afgdkdlkcnsjks

I know my items are here in my city and has been here for over month! They are trying to deliver all at once now and it’s really irritating because had it been something that was time sensitive it wouldn’t have been here. I wish there was a way to opt out of the “combined delivery”. I’ve since stopped ordering from AliExpress in fear that they will combine my latest order with my April’s. STOP THE COMBINED DELIVERY!!,2021-05-28 22:30:18,Lenerz

1810,Never arrived— possible scam?,False,1,"Item still hasn’t arrived and the order is marked finished. I’m sure it has NOTHING to do with the store and is likely because of the USPS and COVID, but unfortunately, AliExpress was extremely hard to communicate with and I am unable to get in touch with anyone, and when I have, emails have been rude and condescending— telling me to check my tracking records when they obviously showed that it never arrived to a sorting location. Very frustrating. If I do receive it, or a replacement, I will gladly update my review. Otherwise this order seems like a scam and I wouldn’t recommend paying even $0.50.",2020-08-24 04:19:52,shoodotz

1812,I love it!.,False,3,"I love this App for Diamond Painting I just wish that I didn’t have to see the “Adult Stuff” While looking for Diamond Paintings. It should just look up what your looking for without all that trash mixed in. 

What if a little kid or teenager was looking for something totally different and came across that stuff!. Disgusting!. 

I love that I get to choose the size and style of diamond drills ( round or squares) and the size of the paintings Nd the price is way better than wish I got 3 paintings for the price of 1 or 2 on wish!. Thanks so much!!.",2020-06-25 01:45:56,Addicted to recolor
1813,Scam...?,False,1,I like to shopping cheap stuff from China like wish. Thought to give a try with AliExpress so I downloaded. There was first time customer deals and I found something I wanna try. When I went purchase it didn’t went through and quickly turn to the order closed due to “security concerns”. Well now my first time customer deal is gone. I felt like they just wanted my information. Also each listing is designed not very well. I guess I just go back to wish and ebay for those cheap shopping. FYI don’t buy something expensive apps like this! Mostly you will disappoint for what you receive.,2020-01-12 22:14:40,aaakkkhhh
1814,Cart empties after pricing several times,False,4,"If you look at your total in your basket a few times to get pricing. After a while it empties on its own. That has happen twice on 2 different orders just before I’m getting ready to pay. Then you have to pay for one at a time or create your basket all over again. That should never happen. It should stay no matter how often you look at total.

It looks like you fixed that problem. Cart no longer emptying 
. I’ve placed several orders science then. Thanks for fixing.

I no longer have that problem. Thank you for fixing.

I had won a freebie and did not catch it in time to pay for it. It’s in my won freebie. Now that I did not pay I never win any freebie. What am I not winning freebies?",2019-12-18 13:21:10,hummingbird_3
1815,I love AliExpress,False,5,I’ve been on AliExpress way before anyone ever knew about it. This is where 90% of your clothing/hair Boutiques get there stuff from. Why pay 40$ for a shirt when you can get the same shirt on here for like 6$ or a coat that’ll cost 100$ but on here for 30$. Ijs I screenshot items I find on social media then click the camera on AliExpress and BOOM there it is the same item for a tune less 🤷🏽‍♀️😎,2019-09-16 22:50:29,QueenOfAli
1816,Shop AliExpress,False,5,"I love to shop on AliExpress! I buy a lot of different little things and not only on Aliexpress for many years. A few years ago, it took a long time to wait, about a few months to receive a parcel. Now packages come much faster. Sometimes even less than two weeks. The quality of goods is not bad, especially considering their cost.",2019-09-15 15:13:04,NikrushJenRush
1817,Amazing!!!,False,5,I use this app a lot and I’m never disappointed when my orders come in. I think I order from this app like 3 times a month (it’s just that good) yea shipping takes a while to get to the US but the wait is worth it and the prices for things are amazing. My family always asks where I’m getting things for soo cheap and they can’t believe it. Definitely recommend!!,2019-09-09 00:52:39,Kpopfanfan
1818,Love it so far,False,5,"The app is pretty cool to me. Like that fact that when I see something on a different app that cost to a while lot of money, I can take a screenshot of it and see different cheaper prices of it and have no shipping cost. That juts o e of the things I really live about it. And you get two freebies a day. So far I won nothing with my freebies but still fun looking at hella cute clothing for a very affordable price!",2019-06-18 21:47:46,Tattii.Leonard
1819,Great app,False,5,This is a great app if your looking for cheap prices but I must say you should definitely at least skim through the reviews before making purchases. And try to look at the ones that have pictures. Most things have free shipping and there are plenty of coupons. I’ve been using this app for a couple of years now and I think that it’s a pretty good app. 😁👌🏾,2019-06-13 00:15:23,kristakatelyn
1820,Already assembled and shipped fast,False,5,"These guys r great. I ordered 3 cases and they all came a week before they were supposed to. I did pay extra for shipping but not a lot like other sellers. They assembled it which most don't and even left wires to connect to controller. As a battery builder this saved me a lot of time. 

Should include the USB adapter but I guess I can have everything at this cheap price for such a great case.",2019-05-04 00:24:15,vicious cycle battery
1821,Great,False,5,I love this app everything about this app. The only thing that I would change is how long it takes to ship clothing. I have to wait more than 3 weeks for one clothing item to arrive. Whatever they are doing with the shipping for hair companies because they get there in 2-5 business days. If the clothing companies had the same it would be great. The prices on here is great!!,2019-04-25 19:30:01,jayslay1
1822,Good,False,5,I have ordered stuff from here yes the things I ordered come perfectly fine nothing damaged looks brand new not skeptical at all some packages come fast some come slower but besides that I haven’t had any issues yes you can refund and you can even give the seller more time to like ship the item certain amount tho like over a 100 days sorry if this review is so long,2019-04-07 01:46:37,oreoloveravage
1823,Incredible experience,False,5,"I love what Ali express has done to the online market place. They let their market place be determined by customers reviews, which has caused competition for sellers and cheap items at competitive quality and quick shipping times for us buyers. The app is also beautifully designed to be user friendly and great customizable search options.",2018-02-04 14:04:50,Therater6575
1824,Beware of buyer protection,False,1,"Truly a 1-star business.

They have cheap products that are fun, but packages will often go missing.  Despite a buyer protection policy with a “money back guarantee” and a “we have your back!” confidence statement, they definitely don’t have the buyer’s best interest in mind.

Their buyer protection does absolutely nothing to protect the buyer.  If anything happens to your package to make it disappear, aliexpress will demand that you submit evidence that you never got it (ummm...say wha??) and will continue forwarding your payment.  (Trust me, I’ve asked what it means to show evidence that your package has gone missing, to which they responded by closing my dispute and saying I didn’t submit evidence in time.)

Fortunately things are cheap-ish, but if this happens with anything expensive, I can easily picture several law suits coming their way....

Stick with more reliable sources, even if you have to pay more.  Or take the gamble; your choice.",2018-12-31 05:26:50,Ck0809
1825,Like and hate,False,2,I like having the ability to shop world wide but hate that Ali express and many Chinese vendors think we’re stupid. They take most over a week to ship saying they ship in 1-3 day and then half even when they send tracking really didn’t ship. I pay for dhl on most items and can still take up to 8 days to get my products. Then aliexpress gives you no way to complain and you can’t file dispute for 10 days so basically they hold your money hostage and you end up with nothing for almost 2 weeks. Its unethical really smh,2018-12-03 18:40:50,ChubbyCheeks_2k13

1829,Ali express,False,4,This is a very awesome place to shop when it comes to prices. There is only one bad thing with them and that is when it comes to disputes.

1845,worth the wait!,False,5,"aliexpress is one of those where you order upur item at a crazy discount, and then it takes forever to get to you. make sure you pay attention to measurements in clothing, and probably just about anything else too. i would recommend getting an image to text translator for your phone, and i would warn against buying any tech beyond chargers etc. all the electronics really will be the budget version. clothing is tiny, but very cute! but if you’re small you’re fine, and if you’re just regular size or bigger (like me) look for clothes tagged “oversized.” anything beyond that, use your best judgement. happy sweat shopping!",2022-01-18 17:10:05,dollfacedotcom

1848,BEWARE OF SCAM,False,1,The whole thing is a giant scam. I placed an order for five different items. Got 3 of them and two that never showed up. Tried to do a dispute but they said to wait longer. By that they want the time that you can dispute charges with your bank to run out. Also they have “freebies” that you can enter in a lottery type of thing. It’s not really free as they want to charge you $0.01. Apparently in the US you cannot charge a card for $0.01 as they block those in case it is a scam charge before they take larger amounts. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your money here.,2021-07-21 14:36:13,Unknowngrl

I don’t understand what kind of evidences is needed when simply I never gotten an item that was ordered 6 months ago. Their support team don’t really help you.

They made me take a loss for the item, and now they will be the ones at a loss by keeping my money for an item I never received.

1941,Worth the wait,False,5,"Took a little time to receive this item, but that was expected from the start. Estimated delivery date itself was pretty accurate and that’s all I ask (for companies to be upfront about delivery times, delays, etc). The product itself was amazing. My little boy was pumped to receive his new F1 cars. Thanks.",2022-01-09 16:52:01,abcmouse09875

1943,Great deals,False,5,AliExpress offers a variety of different products. You can find anything you’re looking for with a very cheap price. The only downside is the shipping time does take quite a while. If you are willing to pay for more shipping then you can skip over that and have it a lot sooner.,2021-12-20 02:16:07,Melyvr533

1946,Customer service,False,5,"No body to communicate with , very frustrating because This is my first time and am checking through the quality of products because I will like to sell resell them. I expected the company’s telephone number to be included on invoices sent but none, no way of communicating back. Thanks Phil",2021-12-06 15:50:09,Dramatic2020
1947,Great app,False,4,"This is a great app to buy at a discount. Yes the shipping time is a deterrent but you are getting things that aren’t readily available at a discount price so the wait time is trade off thus the 4 star rating. The great finds on here is unbelievable, and the prices are phenomenal.  If the shipping time can be expedited, even if I had to pay a little more for that option, I would definitely give it a five star.",2021-12-12 22:48:32,Vibu5

They told me I don’t have valid proof they I didn’t receive it?!? How?!? I have taken the loss based on their last email they’re not giving me my money back.

HOWEVER, the app itself is faulty. i frequently have to constantly refresh to load in pages and my wishlists disappear on some occasions. checkout is, well, it’s barely functional. i’m not sure if this is just a me problem but i’m still a little sad that such a good app is slightly broken.",2021-06-05 07:51:26,VANTEPSD
1956,AliExpress review,False,3,"AliExpress is on the top of my list for shopping apps, but, the comments on the feed are not okay. I have no problem with the feed itself, but older men on this app are sexualizing minors in the comments. it’s disgusting how unauthorized the comments are. examples are when a MINOR, a literal MINOR posts a picture of themselves in the product they purchased, and old men in the comments say stuff like “ooo sexy 🔥😍”, “what a tiny body you have! 😋😋”, “so hot 😘😍😍”, “n*des?”, “I’m horny 🙏🤤”, etc. ITS DISGUSTING AND UNCOMFORTABLE.",2021-05-05 01:34:03,Yuliiissa
1957,Screwed,False,1,This is one of the worst apps I have ever used I went to buy something from this app it came and was not functional. I tried to dispute it to get my money back and they denied it was a valid dispute despite sending in multiple pictures depicting the problems just to have them say that they couldn’t prove that it was from them despite me having pictures of the bag in which it was shipped to me in. Then they won’t even let me appeal anymore and have unequivocally screwed me over. Do not use this app to buy anything it is a waste of time.,2021-04-13 19:06:23,skloiber
1958,My eyeballs are on fire,False,3,"Remember surfing the web back in the 90s? Where every webpage was an revolting explosion of color? This app is just like that. I get a headache using this app because 20 different banners, text, gifs are flashing all over the place trying to get my attention. It’s like trying to navigate a MySpace page 20 years ago. When I use the app, I just want to leave, but on the plus side, it works, so 3 stars.  Note to Ali: Keep the coders, fire the designers",2021-04-08 16:48:07,AshPrince
1959,Too complicated,False,5,"So much going on with so much content. The great value and variety of goods are very tempting, but the app is hard to use and very complicated.

1960,Excellent and easy to use,False,5,"You have to wait. Not longer as most items
Come from China, but with the cost savings and the fact you can literally find anything at discounts up to 80%. It’s great and makes me want to order too many items. 

The shipping is usually cheap or free and many vendors have items in the US, and they arrive in 3-5 days.",2020-10-19 00:54:14,Bjack7777
1961,Shopping experience,False,3,I have had an issue with two of the stores and the other two were fabulous to deal with so I have had a mixed experience. I recommend filling and tracking your packages to ensure they are delivered so you have time to dispute it if there is a problem to get yourself money refunded. The stores that did follow through on delivery were very quick and products were accurate as o the description.,2021-01-29 15:30:30,Klike99
1962,I’m very sorry for this rating. But this is Bad management.,False,1,Sorry for Bad reviews for some product.I wait for my order for about 2 months and I don’t receive the product and they said the product was delivered. When I ask tracking number the customer service they just give tracking number from China not tracking number from USA. So I cannot tracking my order from my post office. For this case I lost my order and lost my money. As a customer I warn everyone who buy from this store For carefully order from this shop for now.,2020-12-23 18:53:31,komalasar1
1963,Not many reliable sellers,False,1,"Not many sellers checked for their credibility are on the site. 
The fact that they can change the delivery to USA from a month to 3. 
Also the fact that they ask you privately for more money after the transaction is finished, and the hardest thing is that it is every hard to report them to someone on Aliexpress. And when even get reported the buyer is not always satisfied.
Also many many liar sellers. You pay for “shipped from USA” and it still take 4-5 weeks to arrive. What’s the point of paying extra??",2020-12-22 16:55:55,AnestisM
1964,Review,False,5,So far things are going great with great prices and fast shipping definitely better than wish or other similar sites!! My first order was small just because I wanted to check it out I was very surprised at how easy it was to navigate through the site and how fast my order was processed and shipped already working on my next order!!!!,2020-09-18 20:52:37,halynsdada
1965,Awesome app!,False,5,I love this app.  I have gotten some great stuff from this app.  Never cheap of messed up stuff.  If I have had a problem for the most part it has been fixed.

Highly recommend !!!,2020-07-26 16:07:03,maegann.s

I’ve actually bought one on here for $12 shipped.",2020-06-15 19:29:07,Sir Ricky Bobby
1968,"First buy, not the last",False,5,"As my first time buying the hair, I was a little skeptical. After about a week I received the hair. At first glance the hair did not seem as advertised. But all you need to do is shampoo and condition it. After doing so the hair looks and feels great. Very little shedding like very little. Ends a little “thin” but it honestly gives it that natural look. Will definitely buy more hair!!",2020-04-11 20:31:49,ESHONNN
1969,Do not order,False,3,Used to get items pretty quick but it’s been 3 months and I haven’t gotten any of my orders. Every other Chinese app I’ve ordered from came in less than 3 weeks. They keep extending my order time from various sellers. I’ve ordered from at least 10 different sellers and paid for expedited shipping with all of them. Nothing is done to protect the buyer from scams like this. They shouldn’t be allowed to use the cheapest shipping method when you pay for expedited shipping.,2020-05-26 18:18:44,bunnywabz
1970,Need a contact for AliExpress for BUSINESSES,False,3,"It’s very frustrating to not have a way to contact anyone with AliExpress without a long, long trial and error of trying to get to a person!  I also am very frustrated that this does not cater better to business persons! Charging SALES TAX is INSANE for a business doing RESALE! For many, many months, I have tried to get this corrected and I get NOWHERE! It is an added cost that is very UNFAIR!  I now work more DIRECTLY with factories bypassing AliExpress for that reason! I hope they fix this and soon!!",2020-04-25 15:37:03,PhotoArtistStudio
1971,Great App,False,5,"App for me works great. You can find almost anything on here. I can pretty much say that of all the things i have bought maybe 1 -2 things i didn’t like.

1972,Find great deals and unique items,False,5,"When I started learning about about dropshipping, I decided to check AliExpress out for myself. While there is a delay in shipping when buying things from China, it can definitely be worth the wait for some items when the price is 1/3 of what you would pay locally. Definitely worth checking out!",2020-02-09 23:08:18,Ryan Roemer

1976,Awesome resource,False,5,I’m so happy with this app. AliExpress is a fantastic resource and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the quality of a lot of the items I’ve purchased. I also appreciate that payment isn’t released until I’ve inspected and accepted my shipment. I’ve only had one order get lost during shipping and the seller refunded me almost before I could ask. Fab experience so far 👍🏼,2019-05-08 20:01:37,JoystickM
1977,😍😍😍,False,5,"Love Aliexpress. Most of the sellers are awesome and true to their words. You can find almost everything on here for good prices, better prices compared to most online merchants.

Great online market",2019-04-08 22:29:13,Samshi31
1978,Very addictive. Last resort for hard to find items,False,5,I have been using this app for over a year. I rely on the app for high quality hard to find items. The shipping is slow for overseas items but you can’t beat the prices and availability of whatever you’re looking for.

1981,I am disappointed,False,1,"I’ve been using aliexpress for many years and I loved it a lot. You can find anything here, but since I change my country of living I can’t pay my orders anymore. I tried changing settings, clearing cookies, added my new card to my account and also contacted customer service. I spoke to 7 different representatives from payment department. And this is hopeless. I just give up because it took me couple days to explain this issue again and again. I am desperate. This is ridiculous that no one can help me out to make a payment!!!

1983,Easy to shop with.,False,5,Great app and easy to use for shopping world wide. The only thing I have issues with is the quality of the items being sold on this platform.

1984,I’m addicted,False,5,"I love hunting for great deals on AliExpress. Some items are a bit of a gamble, some take quite a while to get to the US, but overall it’s a fun shopping experience and most of what I get is great stuff.

Thank you AliExpress!!!",2022-03-03 03:23:22,damocleslore
1994,Great Shopping App,False,4,I often find myself much more interested shopping on this app as opposed to others. Quite the variety of products and there’s always a coupon to be used. Some of the ui is a bit strange but I think that’s more so the nature of the app having you checkout through each individual “store” as opposed to the entire website.,2022-05-10 22:50:47,zakunt
1995,Great shopping experience,False,4,"I love browsing the millions of items available at good prices. The only drawback is you cannot delete your search history.

Lots of these are scams so u have to be super careful and it’s hard to get your money back if you never received a product. They recommend sexual items even tho I never have ever searched up anything sexual and it’s very explicit and it’s not censored. I’d say like 60% of the stuff is on here are scams and products often take MONTHS to arrive and the tracking isn’t very accurate either.,2022-03-06 16:11:48,bbybunnie0405

The shop that I bought my bike wanted $100 for one coil on spark plug wire and you guys charged $18 each so I bought two with expedited shipping it ended up costing $68.

2023,Search needs improvement,False,5,"I wish the app has the following improvements:
1) having the search bar always visible on top. 
2) adding a filter in search to look for cheapest price (including shipping). Because some sellers are offering very cheap prices but very high shipping cost. It is very difficult to segregate them manually.

2033,LOL dolls,False,5,Most dolls I have purchased from this site have been in good condition. Some have been perfect and some have been terrible quality. Usually the ones that are higher priced like Glamstranout are not on the original body and are poorly put together.

2035,Near perfect,False,5,"I really enjoy browsing through the many items. I often start a wishlist and then buy a bit at a time as i can afford ( yeah, they’re cheap but i usually have a really long list).  The only problem is the sizing.

Searching never delivers any results, which makes the app practically useless. 

EDIT: I actually just realized the app doesn’t work at all. When I click on ANY links on the main page, nothing happens.  When I click on one of the featured items, nothing happens. Eventually, the app just crashes.",2018-08-18 23:29:10,Depruett

I contacted AliExpress live chat 10 times in 2 weeks, each time they said they will request a new dispute, asked me for more evidence. I took more photos and videos. Dispute got rejected afte 4 more days of waiting.

2038,"no way to report false ads, shipper tracking scams",False,4,AliExpress lacks the means to clean up the Market. Problems cannot be flagged until after an item is paid for. You cannot tag an item or ad as a fake or takes you to pricing Not The Price in their 'ads'. if 5 or more Buyers Tag the item as a Problem the system should review it.  Only confirmed Buyers should be able to Tag a problem. no web surfing troll-bots.,2018-02-26 19:58:08,Killroy Murphy

You can’t use them for anything other than a few cents at a time…the “super buys” that use many coins are just priced way up..you might pay MORE WITH COINS than not bothering with them. If it was in USA they’d probably get hit with an FTC violation for that. 

The way venders all price stuff low, just to use variations under “color” or “ships from” is tiresome. Just show me the real price for christs sake.

I love this seller if only he carried more products that I need I would just purchase from him.,2020-05-21 00:49:32,djrick321

2083,Total let down!!!,False,2,When I first got this app I loved it. I completely stopped using Wish & Joom and even bragged and recommend it to my friends. The purchases I made in the beginning was on time and as advertised. Now all I keep getting is email after email stating that the seller has extended the shipping weeks and weeks after I had already been told the items had shipped lol. It’s happened at least five times in a row so I will probably no longer be using this app after I receive all my items when I’m 90.,2020-04-20 17:04:33,Sonnier loves it
2084,Great app,False,5,"You just got to look thru the reviews and products to find exactly what you are looking for. Reviews are key!

2085,Quality of Aliexpress has gone down,False,1,"Quality of this app has gone down over the years. Sellers have found new ways to scam you out of your money. Now to hold on to your money or keep it, they purposely put a different tracking number, probably from another customer and it gets delivered to the wrong address successfully. Then getting your money back is a 50 50 chance. Despite being a platinum member this happened to me more than once.

The hair is very very soft and the bundles are a good size . The only thing that I didn’t like about the hair is that the ends of the closure and bundles were bad . It got really thin at the ends so I cut about 3 inches off the closure and the hair has a lot of fly a ways but that’s mostly it I give it a solid 7.5
Probably am buying again though",2019-02-18 21:21:34,ZPgab

Ok fine their API is poor in preventing denial of service. But the app doesn't allow you to reactivate the account.  Beyond having to type in the ridiculously small display character sequence challenge because the website doesn't scale to mobile, that leads to a blank page that does nothing. So great. Alibaba has locked me out of buying anything from the due to the absolutely horrible app/account management. Maybe time to short their stock.",2018-11-03 00:04:28,Dkydkdhfxhc
2093,Great app,False,5,I really love the app but wish it was a little easier to order from favorite stores. They bury the selection for favorite store 3 menus deep.

My only cons: shipping takes forever because it’s from over seas it will take longer so keep that in mind. If placing ordered back to back will delay items once shipped, so try to order all at once or spread the orders out each month. 

Choose vendors that have decent ratings. 4.5 and above on items ( sold over 100) and minimum of 90% store rating for best results in your shopping.

2127,Good for inexpensive stuff,False,5,Just expect longer delivery times since it’s standard Postal Service delivery. It could take up to a month depending on the seller. Read reviews with pictures to know what to expect otherwise your taking a risk and remember you get what you pay for. Sometimes you get lucky and get good quality for less though.,2020-08-10 21:09:50,Awana Sparks
2128,Not the greatest but not too bad.,False,4,"Hasn’t been the best experience as of yet, but still have not received all my items, I have only received 3 out of 6. Earrings were ok, one image was a bit off but for like $2 bucks I can’t complain. Sweater was was really nice but size was a bit tricky to get accurately as sizes are displayed in china sizes I believe, and no size chart comparison was really available. Only disputed one item. A really bad fake Funko pop.",2020-09-03 02:34:03,Bee1149
2129,AliExpress review,False,5,I have ordered several things from AliExpress and so far I have been pretty satisfied with the products.    I have ordered from children shoes to beads for jewelry making.    The items that I have not been  able to use is due to incorrect measurements from my part.   I have learned to double check the measurements on everything I buy.,2020-02-24 16:29:33,simplymayra
2130,NO REFUND,False,1,DO NOt USE ALIEXPRESS! scammers all throughout the entire site ! people trying to con you saying they have children to feed so please send them money also refusing to give you your refund when you sent the hair back in GREAT condition! they have no customer service team or someone you can take too professionally they give you a ROBOT to talk too which gets you nowhere ! NO communication with sellers ! you only get harassed and lied too about the money you paid and for some reason you have to beg or negotiate to get it back after paying a shipping fee yourself they treat you like crap .

The custom canvas is exactly what you previewed. The square drills look great. I like the quality of the plastic bags because I can kit up quickly and not have to buy storage for the drills. I have many Ever

2132,Buyer Beware,False,5,"As with any store, it’s only as good as it monitors the quality of products that it makes available.  I’ve recommended AliExpress many times to friends and strangers.

2133,Love it,False,5,Some things can come long but overall my Brazilian wigs and earrings and bags all came within two weeks . Been shopping on this site since I was 17 I’m 24 now lol. Love it .

I never buy from sellers who have no reviews or no real pictures .,2019-08-21 18:04:38,Vitamin K23
2134,Terrible Ripoff,False,1,"I purchased an item for $189 and the item never shipped. Since it was a fabric item I thought it was being customer made. The shipping status tracker indicated the item was being prepared for weeks.  When I reached out to customer reports the chat bots were sending me in circles endlessly with out any contact with a human.  After 8 weeks the automated chat bots told me I no longer can request a refund because it’s been 8 weeks since the order was placed and they are closing the ticket.  To this day I have not received an apology, nor a refund and I am out $189.  I have been robbed by Alibaba.",2020-01-05 20:18:06,Dwinsto
2135,So far easily a five star,False,4,"I’m giving this app a 4 star but at the moment it deserves a 5 star. I’ve had zero issues so far. I ordered 11 items from different sellers and two have shown up in perfect condition and as exactly described. One of which was early by 3 weeks. If i had experience with returning a item and it was a positive one, I’d give AliExpress a 5 star. That said, in reality 4 stars should always count for excellence.

2136,Awesome!!!,False,5,"I absolutely love Aliexpress! I have been ordering from here for two years, and I get a high-quality items without paying the extra surcharge you get charged in the United States.

2137,Love it!,False,4,"Minor issue with payment, seller contacted me 2x saying my payment never went through after I already received a confirmation stating it was successfully paid.  Ordered on Monday and received it on Thursday.  The wig is not as full as I hoped but it still look beautiful.

They are the worst sellers I have ever bought from on this site!!! My package has been missing for a month in a different town than where I live. And I told them I went to that post office and asked them where it’s at and they said it’s lost and probably won’t be found. So I’ve message the seller and they just keep saying that it’s at the post office and to go get it!! HOW ITS MISSING!!! They won’t give me my money back I have been messaging them for weeks now!!

I can’t even get my money back until the seller approves which is so stupid how. Honestly I’m pretty wish shipping would be faster, wish would probably give me my package by the time AliExpress would process my order.

2141,Doing your homework will pay off,False,4,"Due to the un user-friendly interface, the distance between you and the store creating extended transit times, and the language barrier, it is easy to be disappointed at what arrives if you aren’t careful about communicating what you order and following up with the store afterwards... but if you do all that you can save hundreds of dollars each time you shop, literally",2018-12-22 02:01:14,E•Moran

Hence, I contacted the customer service and they told me to send an email with the documents required to their security team which I did. After DAYS, I received an email from their security team saying I had to do the “My Appeal” through their website, I explained the situation and they ignored that afterwards. Now it has been a week with no response. So I decided to not be their customer if they don’t appreciate their customers.",2018-09-03 07:34:13,Abdullah Al-Mansouri

I contacted them not once not twice not three times but FOUR TIMES!!! They told they’d refund it and were sorry for the wait and that my package never arrived, they guaranteed it and everything but never gave me my 30 bucks back. It’s been a whole year since this happened and it still infuriated me every time I see their ads. I highly do not recommend",2018-08-11 14:23:32,Batfleck26
2146,I like using the app,False,5,"It is very useful, if you don’t mind waiting a little for the products, sometimes little things got lost or were broken and I get a refund quickly, just make sure to check the app often because there is a window for the dispute policy",2022-12-04 17:28:13,Manni101010

It takes from 2 weeks to even 2 months to get some orders! Ridiculous ! They also don’t accept gift cards which is the worst for me since I don’t have a credit or debit card, their rules and «coupons » are ridiculous since you can only use them with only ONE product, etc. Sometimes some sellers don’t even reply back about some concerns with the products....",2018-03-31 06:24:35,Giselle.f58
2148,Unlimited Choices,False,5,"This app has so many choices it is hard to decide what to choose.

2150,App rating,False,4,I love AliExpress so far. I wish they had slightly better descriptions to items and shipped faster but I get shipping is rough now a days and it’s a process to go through.

I’m glad this website exists.,2022-10-11 00:15:13,fancymae
2151,Pretty good,False,4,"Generally pretty good. There is no “home” botton. You have to hit back many times if you have gone into a store and looked at a product.

But lately I noticed a lot of fake customers reviews… Today for example I received a defective product that is not even available anymore. That often happens when sellers sell inferior items.

2167,Only an average app,False,3,This app studders often especially in the “orders” section. As I scroll down 30 orders it randomly takes me back to the beginning. This occurs constantly not occasionally. Further Aliexpress ships to the wrong street address even though my correct address is still listed as the default address. This app does not offer any way to fix the error or any way to contact a human being.,2021-05-11 10:35:18,Nobie007

2172,AliExpress App,False,5,"Good app ... easy to order from. Ads can be a bit misleading on price structure. For Example, a usb stick says it is $5.99 and it will appear at first glance to be the max price for the largest memory. But when you go to order it, the diff choices & prices become apparent.

2175,Great App BUT......,False,3,"I use to Absolutely Love this App. I’ve found some great items with wonderful stores, awesome customer service and professionalism. However my issue is with the app itself..

 I’ve been having problems with the functionality of the app. Not being able to send messages to the sellers which was never a problem before. If I’m spending my money I would like the ability to make inquiries if needed before my purchase.

I’ve tried to reach AliExpress but it’s been pretty much impossible. Customer service has no number, I sent an email and have tried to use the live chat but it continues buffering and does not work. I’ve tried multiple times and multiple devices 

Hope this is fixed soon...",2020-12-06 02:59:19,Amazon Customer 101

Luckily, I ordered super cheap stuff, since only one of the three items I ordered ever showed up. The item that did show up was damaged and the seller said right away that they would send another. That’s the last I’ve heard from them. Never did get a replacement. It was shipped damaged. A chunk was missing, and the piece wasn’t in the envelope or I would have just glued it back together.

Since the coupon option doesnt show up on the mobile app I use the desktop site.

Please help before these expire.",2020-07-27 07:26:27,Marianna2233

I contacted the seller and they said no they were not going to ship it because i bought it when it was a low price and they are selling it for more now so they wont ship it to me. They cancelled my order and i still haven’t received my refund.

That being said, I worry about some of my products in transit, while I found a primer I absolutely love, I don’t want to wait over a month, not knowing what temperatures it endured before me.

I’m forced to shop the competitor … hopefully they get back to their two week promise ~",2020-05-24 05:05:18,Tatihana

2184,Great shopping app.,False,4,This is a very easy fun shopping app. The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating was because I think the iPad version of this app might need to be updated. My cart says oops the system is currently busy please try again later. It’s been saying that for months now. On the iphone I have no problems but on the iPad there seems to be some issues with it. Otherwise I’d give it a 5 star rating.,2019-12-30 23:35:36,SlasherFan119631

I also tried removing adding different items but all gives me same message. But when I kept another order without the coupon it accepted it!! What does that mean?!? It’s clear now there was no issue with anything except you are trying to avoid me using the coupon I have !!! 

I am really disappointed as a big fan and loyal daily customer for this app.",2019-08-26 22:15:07,al3loo

But I have issues with some seller who not accept PAYPAL. (sellers  don’t have a Paypal option)😢☹️. I have to search the item for HOURS, because mostly seller doesn’t have PAYPAL OPTION.

Now I still like it but some shop owners take way to long to process very simple orders. I just don’t understand 5/7 days just to process order.

2212,Lots of products to choose but,False,4,There are many products to choose from however you have to be careful to do your research to make sure that the supplier is legit and actually has the product in stock.

2216,Could be better,False,2,"If it works? - yes, however  you need a good skills to put it together, as there is no instruction abs only things you get is one channel schematic. The compound bents are very cheap , some of them like tube sockets on the border line to be not useful. The chaises is thin and have some sharp ages. The fittings like screws  and nuts, are general and very random , not necessarily the ones you would normally use for the application. I would not even consider it as a kit, this is just poor quality bunch of parts .",2021-04-22 16:28:24,Amazon app tester

2218,MIngram,False,5,Enjoyed shopping with AliExpress. Great variety and options. Better value than AmazonPrime IF you are willing to wait for the long shipment time.

2219,AliExpress is a pretty good app but most things are cheap.,False,3,You definitely need to know what you are getting because a lot of things are super small or cheap quality.

2223,Cool app,False,5,"I originally ordered 3 items (1st time ordering) the only thing that made me apprehensive was after I ordered the estimated delivery was months away seemingly. It prompted me to cancel the more expensive items - but now I regret it because the one I DID keep open was delivered in just a few weeks.

2224,Most vendors are honest.,False,3,"However, not all vendors are honest.  Some will send damaged items or short items. Sometimes shipping is canceled by vendor but I never received a refund.  

Many AliExpress dispute agents don’t seem to have a grasp of English.  

I bought earphones once.  Cordless knock off of Apple earbuds.  The two would not work in unison.  I disputed the item as defective.  The vendor even admitted that some wouldn’t work in unison.  AliExpress refuse to grant a refund.  I called my credit card company and they issued a refund.",2020-10-05 01:37:48,jaxsters
2225,Great application,False,5,This is very great and I really appreciate it.

But they are helping me with this.",2020-01-04 01:08:45,Rating Gmail

I’ve ordered clothes and they’ve either not come at all, and the store says it did come and refuse a refund, or they do come and look nothing like the clothes being advertised. Most importantly the clothes that I have come in contact with have caused me rashes, even after two to three washes.

2233,Often busy and won’t load.,False,3,There are times when the app will randomly say that the system is busy and nothing will load. Once it does that I have to restart the app completely or it will remain that way. My notification and message button that were on the top right corner seemed to have disappeared so I cannot reply to the seller about my missing package. The site and the sellers themselves are great the app just needs some work.,2019-08-12 23:52:21,so7795
2234,🤪🖤,False,5,You get exactly what you pay for! This app has very slow delivery but once you get your items it’s extremely worth the long wait.

2237,Great prices!  Just need to be patient in receiving it!,False,4,I’m shocked at how I can find the same or similar item.  I always check to find it here before I buy from another site.  I just can’t need it immediately.  Items take between 4-8 weeks to receive it. That is the only down side of ordering from this site. And you will deal with people in China so the language may be broken up.,2018-12-28 00:32:04,DC Panda Bear
2238,Love this app!,False,5,"At first I was kinda iffy about buying anything from AliExpress but from my experiences you just have to make sure to buy from sellers who are trusted by other people as well.

2242,Fave,False,5,My favorite place to shop online.

2243,Fake coupons,False,1,I was advertised a coupon right upon opening the app. $5 off if I spent $40. I filled my cart up with $50 total not including shipping. I went to checkout and couldn’t apply the coupon. I spoke to customer service and was disconnected so many times until someone finally told me they “ran out” of the coupons. Then why didn’t they run out of advertising the coupon to me. I spent like thirty minutes on customer service trying to get $5 off and then decided not to check out at all.,2022-11-30 20:39:37,reviewing apps out here

So I am definitely going to be using the app going forward",2022-04-01 02:39:43,Miss. Vie
2251,Lost packages,False,2,"The online merchants always results in losing packages in ordering several items simultaneously. They rarely handled the problems when being reached out. I lost several packages and got no replies or refund. Furthermore, The app plays trick menu options in order for customers unable to reach out for any specific problems. There are also no proof of delivery pictures, whereas they updated the packages as delivered. I have no evidence to speak or fight for my lost packages.",2022-05-24 22:34:51,thanhuyentran

2253,Bait and switch on every single price!,False,1,"Sellers are showing a price for a certain item for sale.  Then you click on that item and find out it’s actually 5x as much and the reason they got away with showing the lower price is because they added an unrelated item that’s not even in the photo and the price you see is for that item.

For example I’m for a bicycle crankset and one is advertised as being 50% off $12 so $6 I’m thinking yeh right and I click on it and no the crankset is $25 (a fair price) and what costs $6 are some random bolts.

They are doing this with almost everything!  I don’t want to do business with a company that does that.

Request: give us the option to change a setting so that it always shows the price of the most expensive item when there are multiple items together.",2022-03-03 21:39:38,Murphwi
2254,Not the same,False,1,"When I first downloaded the app my items would arrive and on time as well but after a few months things don’t get received anymore even after the tracking said it’s been received, the seller can’t really do much after it’s been shipped and trying to get a refund is different when they ask for evidence that you didn’t receive it, what am I supposed to show? and what am I supposed to do now? I wasted around $50 to $60 now and I can’t do anything about it. I’m done using AliExpress",2022-02-23 08:16:37,707mochis

2258,I love shopping in aliexpress,False,5,I was very skeptical about the customer support from the app itself than the seller but the aliexpress customer support and few sellers have been very nice and in contact so it has been a very nice experience so far. This helped me decide to continue shopping from time to time .,2021-10-03 16:54:59,peach😃
2259,Generally speaking,False,5,"I just love Alliexpress! I was ordering through another source and found that Alliexpress has far more of a selection, newest merchandise, and better customer service along with better prices. 
I’d like to take the time to say THANK YOU ALLIEXPRESS. I will continue to get my products from you, you are the best!!",2021-09-12 17:14:41,gabalottt
2260,I LOVE ITT! IT HAS AMAZING DEALS,False,5,"Alex press is a good app if you’re shopping on a budget or you’d like to find something cheaper,
You might also find some things that other websites don’t sell the only problem that I have this app is the shipping is kind of slow it can take about 2 to 3 weeks but it’s still worth it",2021-08-26 03:21:59,thequeenherselfduh
2261,Doesn’t work with iPhone X.,False,5,"I enjoyed this app on my old iPhone 6. Just bought iPhone X and I cannot even sign in. Can’t search for anything and can’t browse by categories. I have to use regular website on safari, which also doesn’t work well as a mobile site.",2021-05-26 17:11:56,Forflower Petite Fleur
2262,The return policy is the worst.,False,3,"I didn't get my parcel and is it a very long time.  I inform the seller but the seller didn’t respond. I check the post office and I didn't get it. When I dispute for refund, the seller is not agree to refund. And Aliexpress not return my money. Even I Appeal. It’s happened to my many parcels. Aliexpress is good for the seller not for the buyer. If you have an alternate Choice, go way from Aliexpress. Is it my responsibility or the seller's responsibility?",2021-07-24 08:44:32,KazyShahed
2263,Great app but needs to protect buyers more,False,3,"Im really enjoying the app, but it needs to protect buyers from unfair sellers. I Bought two wigs from alipearl hair. The seller sent the first one perfect. The second one had issues. I complained and after refunding some money via paypal the seller was very rude and hostile to me and blocked me from buying anything else on their store. Now they ignore my messages. 

Ali express should make it easier to report sellers. So they dont treat buyers bad.",2021-07-13 05:50:43,Coin2020
2264,Love it!,False,5,I have been using this app for a long time now and i love the way they keep updating all the function up to date and never any problem before. All the seller have good communication skill and nice also the product better quality than other app too.,2021-04-14 03:02:11,MevisApril
2265,Scammers and no protection,False,1,"AliExpress doesn’t protect customers!I was scammed by one seller. I ordered one thing from a warehouse in USA and paid for this extra. But seller sent from China without notification and instead of two weeks it takes 4 month!The thing is I am moving in a month and I don’t need this thing in 4 month!!!I would never buy it with this delivery! No money,no goods, and no refund ever!AliExpress closed the dispute and didn’t refund me anything. I was a loyal client for 10 years and will no more. Don’t trust them if you don’t want to be robbed",2021-05-06 02:20:08,anandhgdj
2266,Pretty great ! Great prices !,False,4,It has amazing prices and a great way to communicate with your seller . You just really have to do your research and look at the reviews and rates of each seller before you buy to make sure you don’t receive something that looks nothing like the picture . Seems that happens a lot on this app . But mine turned out amazing .,2021-05-04 23:30:58,jviews.
2267,Better than you think,False,5,"I’ve been using AliExpress now for about a year. It gets a bad rap as a cheap Chinese knockoff site but in all my orders and purchases I have been very satisfied. It may take some looking but you can find good things on here!  Shipping isn’t too bad also, overall I’m happy with it!",2021-02-12 03:53:57,twk67$
2268,Real nice but,False,3,Ive always ordered from Ali since 2020 but one thing I don’t understand is why we have to keep seeing the same items we reported as “inappropriate image” or “I don’t like this item” after pressing I don’t like this item on items that are for sale I keep seeing them and they’re duplicating on my “more to love” section it’s really annoying and I can’t stand it anymore fix your stuff aliexpress,2021-02-20 15:59:58,fr0g g1rl
2269,It’s a weird and wild world out there.,False,5,And AliExpress brings a lot of it right to your door. I’ve bought about 10 things from this app and it takes a couple to a few weeks to make it to the states and so far everything I’ve bought is as advertised.,2021-02-11 18:14:55,Larrylarrylary
2270,Perfect,False,5,"Whenever I need something but don’t need it immediately, I always check Aliexpress for a deal. Shipping varies wildly, but that’s the price you pay for good deals.

 I’ve made 25+ purchases and have only encountered an issue twice, and both times Aliexpress’s conflict resolution gave me swift refunds. Overall, I couldn’t be happier.",2020-12-08 00:54:39,Sir Reggington
2271,Great shopping site,False,5,"Read the descriptions clearly. 
Some of the stuff you can buy is of marginal quality but that should be clear based on the price you’ll pay.  Shipping can take longer than anticipated but often products arrive much earlier than quoted.   Over all I’ve been very happy with my purchases.",2020-11-28 17:01:00,Murphman25
2272,Want cheaper stuff this is the place,False,5,I love this app. It is easy to navigate and to find what I want . I almost always find exactly what I need for a fraction of the price . Yes shipping takes time but it’s worth it! I have had a few orders I never received but I got in contact with the help and they replied immidiatly ! I love bargain shopping and this app makes it easy to do so.,2020-11-11 04:23:34,purple-acorn
2273,Love this app,False,5,"This app is very similar to Wish. They have some amazing items and some that end up not being what you expect. It is a buyer be warned site. 
The app is great though. You can search for items using photos and just search bar, you can communicate with sellers prior to purchasing, just overall a pretty good experience.",2020-11-01 20:10:50,HanksBabyGurl
2274,Shopping Ali,False,5,I have purchased several & I do mean several item with only damage to two. I hope they do not up the prices as shipping & item cost is starting to be almost the same as going to a dollar tree. I wish when you purchase items from the same store they would only charge one shipping cost. I love Ali,2020-09-13 13:28:06,bcrafte
2275,Great app! Love feedback function,False,5,"AliExpress is a very good app. The most important thing is being able to leave feedback more than once! Often an item will fail in a week or two and being able to comment about the failure is super important for everyone.. especially the manufactures!
The best products are always The Best!
Thanks",2020-09-12 00:37:29,Hundonatio
2276,Great place to shopping!,False,5,"It’s awesome and absolutely easy to buy in AliExpress!!
Prices are the best ever! I usually buy many items in here and only once had a very delayed parcel. AliExpress stepped in to solve the situation, since I couldn’t get into an agreement with the seller. Excellent customer service!!!!!! I totally recommend this website for buying great items with amazing prices!!!!!",2020-08-11 22:01:35,Tassisampaio
2277,I love it !,False,5,I order on AliExpress at least once a month from hair to phone cases even sometimes outfits and I am never disappointed .. I wish they had faster shipping times on certain items but that is the only negative thing I can say. If you are ordering hair though .. you will receive your product very fast 👏🏽,2020-06-25 03:07:43,_yeskiki
2278,My Box Braid Wig,False,5,"I was a little skeptical at first about shopping with AliExpress. I was told so many negative things. However I decided to give it a try and I’m happy I did. Not only does it look just like the wig I saw it looks better !!!! Also it came right when it was supposed to arrive. I’m will most definitely shop with AliExpress again!!!
I’m a very happy camper 😄",2020-04-28 17:14:05,TMarsh51
2279,Everything’s cheap,False,3,"Or so it seems. They can sometimes get you by charging the same amount for shipping as the item you purchased. And shipping is either super fast or takes forever BTW. Still waiting on an order from February. But Most items are as advertised, just make sure you enlarge the pics of items your concerned about first. Plus, I haven’t ordered that much, yet. The sellers are pretty efficient though And respond quickly. Super nice.",2020-04-26 08:53:05,imagatastic
2280,Very nice,False,5,If you are on a budget there are many things you can find on there. Usually I buy tops and false eyelashes. It can take awhile for things to come in but most of the time the stuff does come in. If your order doesn’t come in after it tells you when it should; they are usually very good about returning your money.,2020-04-17 07:12:28,Awesome 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
2281,Very convenient way of buying stuff,False,5,I’ve been using Alibaba/Ali Express for a long time already. Their app is so easy & convenient to use. I’m very pleased of the products I get from them! The app also helps to find out which products are cheaper & which is better than the other. I love doing business with them!! More power!,2019-12-30 15:56:03,racquesc
2282,Just read store reviews carefully and you won’t be disappointed :),False,5,"I’ve been using this app for a year now, I’ve only twice had SOME type of problem that were both resolved perfectly and accurately. You can get some awesome stuff at great prices, just be sure to read reviews. And leave them to help other members!",2019-10-18 03:32:35,SyringeLatte
2283,Very unprofessional don’t waste your money,False,1,I really hate to give it one star. I purchased a item and when I received it the item didn’t work. I have been trying to open a dispute for a week now but the system has been down. I contacted the seller first I was told to email them a video of the product then I was told to send pictures of how I place the batteries in the item now they just keep giving me the run around about my refund. This has been the worst online experience I’ve ever had it is very unprofessional and doesn’t seem to care about customers.,2019-11-18 08:30:49,absndb
2284,Doesn’t let me check out or delete from my cart,False,2,"Please fix check out ! I have been buying my supplies from this app, monthly for years. Lately I am not able to checkout or remove items from my cart and it has been super frustrating. When you try to reach out to someone on chat support you get no where. I understand the difference in time from where I am so I made sure I was trying to chat with someone when it was day (business hours) there. Hope it gets fixed soon.",2019-10-21 07:03:45,HMLamb
2285,AliExpress is the Best,False,5,I totally love AliExpress and it’s very professional representatives that’s there to assist me in every way possible. An amazing opportunity to shop with peace of mind knowing that AliExpress is there to make sure everything goes smoothly with satisfaction guaranteed in the end. Thank you so much and I will continue to shop and recommend others to do so as well. Thank you,2019-06-18 16:16:36,jeep peace
2286,Mostly great,False,4,"Message system needs some work; I’ve had to log in to the site on my computer a few times to see all parts of a conversation (some entries from sellers are not visible in the thread once I’ve read them). The option to request more time doesn’t seem to be available from the app. Otherwise, it’s great: easy to browse items, see reviews of sellers, and purchase.",2019-07-16 00:45:42,AziDahaka
2287,NOT A SCAM,False,5,"I LOVE this app/site. I try to put everyone on to it. Sometimes the shipping takes a while and once I never received purchased items, but they were small jewelry so I can imagine they got lost. AliExpress facilitated a speedy refund and i have since had no issues with them. I’ve been using this app/site for years now. You WILL NOT be disappointed.",2019-06-11 17:29:14,autumnr3nee
2288,Great shopping app.,False,5,I’ve been using this app for years now and it has never failed. A lot of great finds as well as great prices. Whenever there is an issue they take you serious and always find a resolution. I’ve been satisfied with the service as well as the products. I recommend this app to those who haven’t tried it yet.,2019-05-18 03:28:39,silver.texas
2289,Aliexpress is even better with the app.,False,5,You get mobile only prices. It is easier to select multiple items on the basket page comparing to a computer. Leaving feedback with photos are a lot easier with the app. I use Aliexpress very frequently and this app makes the whole experience even better.,2019-04-07 21:56:33,Gtr-savas
2290,Great App!,False,5,"AliExpress is not a retailer, it’s a platform used by other business to sell their merchandise. Therefor that seller that you had a unpleasant experience with has nothing to do with AliExpress or their App. The app is very easy to manage and search/look for items. I’ve been using AliExpress for a very long time and there App has improved a lot and for the better!",2019-03-05 23:44:17,A_TY4
2291,Great Products at Lowest Prices!,False,5,"I have used this app to purchase a number of things ranging from toys and fidgets, kitchen accessories, and auto accessories. 99% of my orders have arrived in pristine condition, exactly as the app description stated. The free shipping is great, as long as you don’t mind waiting, which I’m more than happy to do in order to continue to receive great products at rock bottom prices!",2019-01-13 23:49:18,MagoBago
2292,ALIEXPRESS,False,5,"I love this app...but more importantly the people who sell their products and the products they sell! Nine times out of ten, products are as described! Then once in a blue moon if you are not careful you get a very badly ma ""Made in China"" toxic filled, chemical I smelling, fake feeling product! But hey! You are paying pennies on the dollar for this stuff and you are not going get a better price anywhere else!
Isle Of Jersey! USA",2017-12-10 22:13:45,Redtruckzoom2
2293,Works Well Couple Suggestions,False,4,"1st HUGE suggestion....it would be extremely helpful to the buyer/customer if I could see from the main page if I have already favorited an item or not (like in the Free People app). It is quite time consuming and inconvenient to have to open multiple products just to see if you u’ve already liked it or not. 

I also wish there was a way to search by shipping type. In case we were looking for someone w/epacket to USA, choosing free was what we chose. 

Nice selection. 

Would also be cool if you could have the option to browse that product and have it listed along with/compare store infos for items that appear multiple times from different cafes.  Hahaha",2018-04-07 08:02:26,afraiser
2294,I love cheap stuff,False,5,"Almost everything we buy today is manufactured and comes from China. Beat out the middle man and get it direct. Some things the price with shipping is close to if not more then what you would pay in the US but for most it is considerably cheaper. 
Great App and great website.",2022-11-30 20:21:02,Mercury Vintage Timepieces
2295,Great App For High Quality Cheap Items,False,5,I love using this app when I really want something and all other apps have it priced at something really expensive. The only downside is it takes around 2 to 3 months for your item to come in but it is 'usually' always worth it.,2022-05-24 22:18:19,lil_amy636
2296,Stay away from fraudulent platform,False,1,"The mission of the platform is to provide safe and fair place for business. AliExpress is blatantly disregard any documents from buyer. They are not even reviewing cases. The outcome of the disputes will be in the seller favor no matter what. The only way to fight them is dispute with credit card company and collect all documents. You will be wasting your time and money ordering on AliExpress platform, it will be more expensive, longer shipping time and absolutely no protection for buyer. You will have better chances on EBay.",2022-11-01 21:15:06,Al637654

2298,Is as good as the competitors but better prices.,False,5,Was apprehensive at the beginning but they did the best job of pleasing my curiosity as a customer that I change my opinion and now I’m a regular shopper. Is as good as the competitors but better prices. Is been a while since my last review so i have to say im still satisfied with it.,2022-02-10 18:52:58,pedroandujal
2299,Shipping takes to long.,False,2,"I bought four things from here only one thing came. I bought a lot of items on here, all that came was the backpack. The shipping takes forever! It’s always delayed and takes more than a month. I’t won’t let me put a dispute on the credit card, I have to go to the credit card to do that. I suggest buying from someone else unless you want to wait a year or have it never come.",2022-02-13 21:31:34,safe kid 2019
2300,Cool gadget to buy,False,5,This company has some cool gadgets that you can buy without hurting your wallet. Been using the app for almost a year and gotta say everything seems great. Most product are exactly the same as the one in the listing picture. Most order will arrive in about a month or so.,2022-02-09 20:57:34,xXJoy007Xx
2301,I find myself coming back daily,False,5,Overall 3 1/2 to 4 it will be cheaper but may arrive damaged they will refund you immediately and just ship back 50-50 comes from far away still good deals and they have farming where you can get free coin andAnd can bet it onto gambling’s on more coin,2021-10-29 22:56:31,Dr' Strangelove
2302,Good but…,False,4,"It could use a few fixes like when I’m searching my “shipped” items it keeps loading and starting back from the top. Also, when an update to an item notification comes through it takes me to the tracking info but I don’t what the item is. Other than that it is great.",2022-02-04 02:32:48,Braddock_MIA
2303,"Great app, but there are some issues with payment.",False,4,"Lot of great deals, lot of savings, wide variety of items, and an easy to use interface!

Aside from that, it’s my favorite place to shop.",2022-01-13 22:03:34,Blaine011
2304,Best of the Best🥇,False,5,"The AliExpress app is incredibly easy to navigate. Which is saying a lot considering how much it contains. It’s a breeze to get from place to place, and back without getting lost or loosing your focus! And it’s a fun app as well, making you want to stay and play! These developers have done a fabulous job!",2021-10-23 21:24:02,Gordon1551
2305,Try it!! You won’t regret,False,5,"Initially I had my doubts to buy here, I was distrusted. But now I am happy to have given it a chance, I am craft lady and I find a lot of material 1/4 of the price that I would pay local for the same product. It takes about 2 to 3 weeks to arrive but it is worth the wait.",2021-08-04 05:09:16,BowBow Lady
2306,My new favorite place to get things for cheap!,False,5,"Ever since I discovered this app I’ve been in love. It’s really simple to use and I love that you can rack up on coins everyday to help you get coupons!

2307,AliExpress review,False,5,I really love this site i buy most of my wigs off here. I think you guys do an amazing job with your products only concern I would say is most of the products take a very long time to get here. I think that would be the only thing to fix other than that love this site!,2021-05-26 17:21:36,Jay lay 2001
2308,Favorite online store,False,5,"I love shopping on Aliexpress it’s my favorite, the prices are great. 
My only con is when they are sales, the sellers deceive people, the prices doesn’t really go down, they only increase the initial price and remove like 1cent from the original price. Please stop trying to deceive us. Other than that it’s great.",2021-04-23 12:27:27,p-som
2309,Work great,False,5,I’ve used this product religiously because of my oily skin. It’s pulls those oils out immediately and the different heads offer the comfort of how gentle or how vigorously you want to apply the session. I would suggest anyone to use this if you have really oily skin. Shipping took a while but I expected it since I liv in the United States.,2021-03-27 00:48:19,AnitaT45
2310,never arrived,False,1,"I would give this zero stars, in July or august of 2020 I ordered SOOOO many things so so many things and I have not got 1 refund after requesting it for all items after not arriving, and not 1 of them has been delivered to my house, it says delivered and has never came some are still shipping after like 9 months? I can no longer ask for a refund and I would have to pay to ship it back because some have already landed in the us I will not be using this app again, there does tons of my money😐",2021-04-16 20:08:14,Defaults make me ahh

2313,Great if you are patient!,False,5,As long as you are patient and make sure the item has good reviews it’s great!

2314,Very good app,False,5,"I love this  app so much and I can trust it because I have bought so many products and all of them were perfect.

2316,Worst Customer service ever,False,1,I disputed an order because it didn’t came and the tracking shows delivery error. Kept me waiting for 2 months just to tell me that the package is for pick up when I confirmed that is not. I kept uploading pics of the tracker and it shows delivery error and also went to postal office and they could not find it. The protection ran out and they’ve closed the dispute with the reason that I’ve confirmed to them that I’ve received it when I did not. I am never going to use this app again.,2020-12-15 14:30:16,Kdndiiwiqhhqhwzbdb
2317,Horrible No Human Support At ALL!!,False,1,Go ahead and prove me wrong I have google how to have someone to talked to about some charges that took place and there isn’t a customer service at all just some BOT that answers you with 2 word answers. I been using the service for over 2 1/2 years and now that I have incurred a huge problem there is no support whatsoever this is horrible I can’t believe this is happening to me. Hope they find a solution to having human support soon as from my research they haven’t had any for over 4 years.,2020-12-10 20:10:20,pabloescobar178
2318,5 Star,False,5,"AliExpress is a great user friendly App.

I appreciate the honesty and great communication with friendly people that are great to do business with...especially when you can’t always afford to get items elsewhere!",2020-10-18 15:00:18,Nicci's Review
2319,Change in messengering good,False,5,I complained about the app for iPhone because the messages were impossible to read because the icons were very close together. They change the app altogether and I’m happy about that. I do wish there was a way to get freebies and such on the web based version but I guess that’s not gonna happen.,2020-10-06 00:35:39,Bill Suits

Soon as I get paid here I am scrolling looking for stuff tht catches my eyes putting it in my cart, and the fun part is checking the mail every day to see if my package is here. The funner part is opening my package to see my item tht always looks just like it’s advertised thts one big reason why I like this app.",2020-08-28 06:29:59,teezee baby
2321,Never Have Had A Problem,False,5,Great place to get certain items from for such a great price as long as you’re willing to wait. Refunds are also easy if a product has not been sold to you as advertised. This has only happened to me about 3 times in the many many many times I’ve ordered from here.,2020-08-15 20:47:16,Blackblooded696
2322,CH - SU Stamps and dies,False,5,I was very pleased with the service. It came quickly and the order was accurate. I got everything I ordered. The product is good quality for the price.

2323,I’m Addicted!,False,5,This site puts Wish in the dirt! So many great products at great prices and much more user friendly than other sites. You can filter and image search and do so many more helpful things! Also shipping seems to be quicker than most and fairly reliable. Thank you for this service! Please don’t change!,2020-06-02 17:25:50,Luciaodoyle
2324,Horrible service,False,1,I waited nearly a month for my merchandise so I decided to dispute the order and request a refund. The seller kept telling me to be patient and the company “stepped in” to help but still nothing. No merchandise and no refund! It’s to the point where I am tired of going back and forth and they can just keep my $60. It’s really a shame because I feel like I got scammed and AliExpress refuses to do anything about it. They tell you to contact customer support but you never get someone on the phone. I will never use this site or app again. The entire process was a headache.,2020-06-24 14:10:18,shanicee21

2326,Love Ali express,False,5,I use Ali express a lot and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends.  It’s amazing what you can find and saves hours of time searching in stores and usually cheaper.

Con: But I go into my acct to confirm orders or check orders, or want to look at tracking, each time it takes me back to the first page of my orders.

2330,Not Shipping Paid Items,False,3,"I’ve always like Ali but now I have 33 items in my cart waiting to be shipped for almost a month now when it normally takes only a few days. 

If items are being held up because of the virus, Ali should inform their customers. They should also tell us expected shipment date instead the venders keep telling us the Chinese New Year is extended. We can easily google that to find out it is because of the virus.",2020-02-12 22:44:01,Ri#%*+
2331,User interface Malfunction,False,1,I am so tried of this app. It seem to crash and when I try to search for an item it’ll tell me that it can’t be found. The only thing that will work are links from the home page. But any kind of search whether it’s a photo search or typed into the search bar “can’t be found”  even if I search “clothes”. I have tried deleting it and redone loading it but it always crashes and I always end up heading over to my browser to use the website instead. There is no point in having this app.,2020-01-04 19:06:48,lindsayher

2336,Vast array of options,False,4,"If you’ve seen it advertised on Facebook or instagram, AliExpress probably has it and for much less. Just realize you’re dealing with their postal service and customs and know up front you may be waiting a long time for your orders.

However, one of my item did not come and I opened a dispute about it but the customer service was horrible. Took forever to resolve the issue and at the end, they released the funds to the seller anyways even though I did not receive the item. So I basically lost my money. Now I’m afraid to order again on this app in case this situation might happen again...",2019-06-27 05:00:52,james6980
2338,Outstanding,False,5,"Just be sure to read descriptions before purchasing and giving sellers a bad review because you neglected to read details. 
I’ve found many incredible deals and have dealt with amazing sellers on this app.

2339,Awesome!,False,5,"I’m really impressed with this. The responsiveness was great and I received it in US without any issues. If you need a backdrop for a very high quality up-close situation, this may not be the product for you. If you need a backdrop that would be 3’+ away from your subject, this is a KILLER DEAL.

2343,An Okay App,False,3,"Haven’t really had a bad experience with Aliexpress and the buyers on there, BUT I am aware that Aliexpress provides little to no protection against scammers and bad companies on their site. From seeing others experiences with purchasing hair, sometimes communication with the buyers is poor and getting refunds are basically a 9-5 job: HARD! I also don’t like how they charge $5 to use PayPal as your payment method, but I still use it because PayPal offers me protection for my purchases.",2018-06-29 23:51:38,XVINANA

2354,Amazing,False,5,"Aliexpress is great if you know how to spot good quality items. I’ve gotten so many beautiful pieces from here that look genuine and made with great materials.

2359,Could be more user friendly.,False,4,"Its always fun to shop at Ali Express.  However, i think there is still room for improvement.

It was a solid women’s two piece set and it says delivered but I never received it. I’m very disappointed with the shipping situation. I probably won’t order anything else until I receive my outfit. I ordered 3 items and the two was successfully delivered but the Kornelia store didn’t deliver my outfit or delivered it to the wrong place. So I rated one star because you never know what you will get when you order with China.,2021-11-17 02:33:12,Aamberg

I filed for a refund and they stated they assumed I contacted the postal office to retrieve my package. (Which did not happen and I can prove it) They denied my refund and won’t speak to me or review my case. Those at AliExpress are liars thieves and swindlers. I actively try to dissuade people from using their service. It’s only a matter of time before you are cheated too.

2371,Great prices,False,5,It’s a great app where you can find amazing deals on all kinds of things at low low prices.

2372,Pay close attention and you can’t go wrong!,False,5,This app is amazing. I find discounted room decor and accessories for great prices. Definitely feels more reliable than Wish.

2375,AliExpress,False,5,"Pretty good stuff if you do some research into each seller before you buy. Not all sellers are equal and there are some lemons but you can get some very good stuff for rock bottom prices, so far my experience has been mostly positive. I don’t anticipate ceasing to do business with them in the foreseeable future.",2021-02-26 23:59:48,Jaeger1984
2376,Good but has a few quirks,False,4,It’s over a very good app with great prices but the problem is that it’ll list prices for something as really low and then you click on it it’s just a bunch of versions of the product and the part that you don’t want is listed as that price and other things are more expensive,2021-03-07 03:04:41,MohoSami

2380,I love Ali Express,False,5,"Most of the items I’ve ordered have been better quality than I expected for the price. The time it takes items to ship can be long, so don’t order last minute if you need something right away. Give yourself at least four weeks. If you can do that you will definitely LOVE Ali Express. I do!!",2020-06-26 08:49:32,ElleAdams
2381,Read the reviews,False,5,I study reviews people put emotions into what they write. Other people who are in country’s that has no way for a person to legally sue!

2382,Aliexpress is good,False,4,"Overall the app is really good. But it would’ve been better if I didn’t have to contact the seller for a refund. I wish Aliexpress would let me handle it instead of me having to call my bank and do all this extra stuff.

2383,Should be more complete and easier to navigate,False,3,"Should be more convenient to track what has been ordered. Also, I can’t see past orders after I’ve reviewed it. What if I want to re order after a while? Would be good to have easy access to view everything I’ve ever ordered.

Also, after I confirm one item received, I have to back to the beginning of the order list before I can find the next item. This is inefficient.",2020-06-01 11:58:17,Ammie33333
2384,Review,False,4,"Aliexpress has amazing items to choose from & everything that i have ordered has been accurate. The only reason it’s 4/5 is because the shipping takes forever, the usual shipping time is 7-14 business days but sometimes i had to wait longer.

2388,Feedback,False,5,"I love AliExpress - I always use, I can find everything that I want and need. The only problem that I have and I believe everybody agrees and have the same problem is the shipping and how long it takes for an item to be delievered.

Otherwise thank you so much for this great service.",2019-08-29 09:48:24,MajSak
2389,"Two stars for the shop, not the app",False,2,"The app works great, have yet to experience troubles with it. But when you buy something from AliExpress, it takes FOREVER, to arrive. I ordered some paint brushes and was told it would be delivered around 2 weeks. This is just an estimate. But it’s been a month, I have not received anything and I can’t make inquires about it until closer to two months of not receiving my product. So if you get this app, keep in mind that shipping is long and perhaps not worth buying from AliExpress.",2019-10-25 20:51:33,Kitkat Aden
2390,Fantastic,False,5,"Very easy to use and pictures from other customers help very much. Great way to shop.

2391,Great app,False,5,Feels almost like the eBay app. Works very well and doesn't freeze. I would recommend in the next update to have a link to check tracking.

2394,Good app,False,5,"Great app; you can find a lot of stuff that’s available on eBay for less here (arts/craft supplies, anyways) though for some reason shipping appears to take much longer for pretty much everything even though it’s coming from the same places.

I sent pictures of the big package that held 2 smaller packages, and the contents within the bags. They just dismissed my dispute as if nothing was wrong.

Now, I need to login, pass two stage auth, proof that I’m not a bot, and only then even begin to understand what they are talking about.

And I tried to call and all there numbers were wrong and said “ the number you are calling is out of order” I tried to email them and that didn’t work either!!

The seller keeps asking me to increase the time allowed and wants to send a different color etc. I have sent 5 cancellation requests and they deny them. AliExpress says the seller has to approve the cancel, and the seller won’t. Absolutely ridiculous. Spend your money carefully with these people.",2019-05-12 19:42:31,GoMachV

I have spent about $800 in the last month and only had one problem with a product. I ordered 3 items from the same seller and one of the goods came damaged.  I opened a dispute and AliExpress made 2 proposals: I keep the product and receive a partial refund or I pay for return shipping and receive a full refund.

All of this info wasn’t provided until I disputed the claim and aliexpress themselves dismissed my claim because I had no evidence that it wasn’t delivered? What evidence am I suppose to provide???

2544,Horrible Customer Service,False,1,My first time using AliExpress and it has been a horrible experience. Returning an item and receiving a refund is such a hassle. The vendor should not be allowed to close a dispute without proof from the customer that the issue was resolved. The vendor I purchased from did not refund my money and closed the dispute. There is no way for the customer to appeal it especially if it’s after the 15 day protection period. Please fix this.

The only catches are: 1, it’s hard to get your money back for a failed ship and 2, the material isn’t always great since it’s coming from far and it’s so cheap.

My DEAR CONSUMERS PLS DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME, AND EFFORT WITH THIS COMPANY. 

I have purchased over $900 from this company, 70% of the items ordered from them are Either defective or far from the description listed on their related site. 
Or I don’t receive my items on promised date, then it takes them an other 65 to 90 days more, assuming it arrives at all. 

I have filed at-least 35 disputes with the company on the items I purchased and have not received one single refund nor satisfactory outcome from them. 

 They find every excuse in the world to refuse to refund the money you spent with them, even when the item doesn’t arrive or is defective/damaged on arrival.

AliExpress is doing eCommerce at a global scale with a singular platform. App performance is a little wonky. Internal errors sometimes make its way to the front end.

You need more options in the drop down when disputing.

Hold the sellers accountable for items not received, delays due to chine New Years and other holidays that will delay orders

Buyers should be able to contact a support team if there is a problem in a timely fashion

If a buyer only received part of the order, the buyer should be able to check only those items in

Once the order is place and received those items should not just sit with all orders. Move those items to another location for the buyer if they want to order again. This is helpful so you can see what’s left in all orders to receive.

Highly recommend it.",2019-06-17 15:49:36,jrdnhrrsn
2672,Great,False,4,"While it is a market place that may appear sketchy because it’s so inexpensive, they do a great job at making you feel safe. You can confirm when your order comes in and is in good shape, and they withhold your payment until you do so with certain companies. The app runs pretty well, although it does crash sometimes or pull up random results. Enjoyable!",2019-08-31 19:52:22,Black&Brown Dashound
2673,All of my Purchases,False,5,"I’m very happy with all of the amazing items I have gotten from AliExpress. All of the shops are amazing and quality is amazing too.

2674,Loved it,False,5,"I have always received everything I ordered as requested. Some sellers take much longer than others, but as long as you are not in a rush and have time to wait for shipments from China, the savings is worth it, and very often the same items that companies here in the US resell with new labeling for huge markups",2019-04-25 21:16:05,B_sentinel
2675,Addicted,False,4,I absolutely love this app. I'm terribly addicted. However be aware that in the part where you can earn their little coin things. That you will never get any of the items they show that are however many coins plus $0.01. Even if your in there at midnight. Everything that supposed to a penny is gone before you will even be able to look at it.,2019-05-04 10:20:36,Psychonerd
2676,SAVING $$,False,5,"Love, love, love this app/store. You can buy items at a fraction of the price than America. All you have to do is wait. It does take time to ship to the US.

Never have I felt like I was cheaped out on my $$. 10/10 would recommend!",2019-03-17 09:41:09,Instagram tina_ratsamy1998
2677,The best of AliExpress,False,5,"As a mobile app, AliExpress can be a bit overwhelming with its amount of menus and buttons and hidden features, but once you get used to it, it’s pretty good.
My favorite part is how it destroys the third wall, and shows you the actual cost it takes to produce goods, with what is likely, very slim margins.
Entertaining to see closer to the real cost of goods.",2019-02-03 15:48:51,Jesse_D_
2678,Could be more handy,False,3,"This review is just about the app, not the shop. It’s designed for some mad sales kinda “Wow! I buy this and that too...” but sometimes you can’t find what you do really need. So you’ve gotta go to the website and search there. Interface is messy and illogical and you have to wade through loads of worthless “coupons” and absolutely fake “sales”. But buying process itself is user friendly, comfortable and fast.",2018-08-31 18:50:21,Somnru
2679,"Great Deals, “Meh” Interface",False,3,"I love the great deals to be found.  As long as you don’t mind waiting a few weeks to get your stuff, there are some rocking bargains to be had.

Not as crazy about the app itself, though.  It’s sometimes a little tedious to navigate because you’ll start following something and then have to press the “back” button several times just to get to someplace where you can access the menu.",2018-03-27 01:37:50,BriGuy1968
2680,Compliments Well,False,5,This App compliments the online account... The app does what it's suppose to do... I think this app is meant to be used in conjecture with the desktop/laptop account and not meant to be a replacement of. The web account talks back to too many other web applications for this app to work the same... This app gets the job done.,2018-02-13 16:29:40,1Lint

2682,Love this app!!,False,5,"I love the price on the items listed.  I Find so many goodies.  Shipping is slow so if you want it fast you'll pay a lot for it.

Frequently I don’t have any communication I read the size I read the fabric and less there’s a problem there’s no reason to communicate so the article arrives on time it’s pretty much the way it was advertised but I can’t submit it because I didn’t leave a review so should I tell say one star that’s not fair should I say five stars that’s not true.

2696,It’s difficult to navigate the site.,False,2,"The site seems unorganized & it gets confusing when you add something to your cart. It seems as though the item has been paid for already.

2721,Bait and gouge. Not able to trust.,False,1,I once gave this app full stars because it has an options that let you choose only items with free shipping.  I appreciate knowing the full cost up front. Now after I ordered the stores  have sent messages requiring shipping costs that can be a half or third more then I already paid.

2724,Friendly Interface,False,4,"Functional app for shopping without a full-size computer. Pretty easy to search and navigate, but sprinkled with some odd repetitive links within “stores” that may contain unrelated or competitive items.

2726,Convenient and easy,False,4,"Love buying from AliExpress, the app makes it so much move easier to look through items without the hassle of going on google on my phone to look up things I need.

2731,Everything takes to long to ship,False,3,I’m highly addicted to this app and the only thing keeping me from giving five stars is how long everything takes to get here I realize most things are shipped out of the country but it’s insane to have to wait almost a month sometimes more for something to reach me but the prices are amazing and the things being sold are almost always accurate,2020-04-23 17:03:53,K_ROSS23

2737,Great app,False,5,Does the job efficiently. You get a lot of deals using the app to make orders.

2738,Great prices and all items.,False,5,"There’s many great items on there. You’ll always find what you’re looking for on this app. There’s many different sellers, and therefore, your items trickle in instead of all at once, which is a con.

It feels as if it’s a smooth sheet of latex, not woven, but it is very breathable. Even the elastic waistband is silky.  The garment is seamless, with the pouch formed from the basic material. A minor criticism would be that the pouch could be a bit more roomy and prominent. But overall, this is a unique design and excellent value for the price.",2019-04-20 02:24:44,JVP in Silverlake
2742,AliExpress thinks I’m a pervert,False,4,"Okay. I admit it. I saw an item that was funny/sexual in nature and I clicked on it. It was a shampoo and conditioner shower holder that was shaped like breasts. Now 20% of the items in my suggested stream are really weird, mostly sexual. I can’t open aliexpress in front of my friends because half my suggested items are penis shaped wine glasses, etc. Is there a way to reconcile my stream and make it reflect my much more moderate sexual behaviors?",2019-04-22 02:41:24,GeraldDP
2743,Download this app,False,5,I love AliExpress! You can get so many good quality items directly from the overseas manufacturer at the wholesale price. It’s a long wait most of the time but if it isn’t something you need immediately who cares? They have great sales and it’s generally very easy to communicate directly with the sellers. I recommend this app,2019-01-15 16:01:00,Jvolmmer341
2744,They have EVERYTHING!,False,4,They have so much stuff for lower prices!! I like to buy certain things in bulk so when the prices are low that’s when you should buy more.

2897,Good Site,False,4,"Nice app! I especially like the customer protection part. I think we should extend the dispute time or open a product quality review dispute period as some products go bad immediately after the open dispute period must have elapsed.

2947,my review,False,1,"Hello dear,

We as moroccan community of buyers from your platform, we are facing a serious problem these days ! 

We want to inform you that your ALIEXPRESS STANDARD SHIPPING to MOROCCO was suspended  by your platform without a convincing reason
And we noticed that free shipping is no longer a choice among the choices that sellers gives. 

We still receive some packages and that proves that our government has no hand in restricting/refusing to receive parcels from China 
And many shipping companies like “ SUNYOU-SF PARCEL-CAINIAO -YANWEN-POSTNL Singapore “ still shipping to MOROCCO until now.

Though, our neighbors countries such as ( Algeria, Tunisia ) and also the rest of world , do have the "" AliExpress Standard shipping and free shipping "" choice.
We Would be highly grateful if you could look into the matter and take actions.

Looking forward to your reply within shortest time",2021-06-20 16:46:46,elmhamz

Now you can only see one item at a time on the home page and your account page. It’s very hard to find the places for disputes, to read your messages, and so much more that you might need. You need to go back to the adjustable orientation. I’ll be shopping much less because I can’t deal with the frustration.",2020-08-11 05:22:48,RustysMom0613

3056,Great website!,False,5,"I love this website! It’s a great place to find high quality foreign made products! I’ve never had issues with any seller I’ve bought from.

I opened a dispute since the company automatically said products arrived when they never did. I saw several other reviews stating as such.

The sellers always cheat, be very careful. DO NOT BUY ELECTRIC OR BATTERY OPERATED ITEMS as they all have bad quality. 
Also sellers pretend to have shipped items and put a fake tracking number so that they’ll take the rating of quick shipping. 
When you open a dispute, AliExpress does not believe that you did not receive the item and will not refund you. 
I highly recommend you NOT deal with AliExpress.",2020-01-18 08:20:38,Kalista Rayb
3062,Great option,False,5,Overall experience is great! I’ve been using this app for about 8 years and had an issue with a dishonest seller only once. Just be very attentive to the seller.

3072,Awful,False,1,I wouldn’t buy from this app. I bought from this seller called forever hair and the quality on the hair was bad but I chuck that up to maybe just getting a bad batch. Then I opened a dispute to get a partial refund and the seller contacted me via my phone number and harassed me to get the dispute cancelled by offering me not even 20% of what I paid. However the real horrifying factor in all of this is that she was able to go through all the information I put on my account and got my phone number through the app. Don’t buy off of here!,2019-04-01 04:04:01,pineapplepsychic

Before 2 weeks I ordered some items but aliexpress they closed the order to verify the identity. I uploaded my documents 3 times on their site and I send them email as their customer service told me to do that. The documents were ID, passport, driver license, utility bill and bank statements.

3086,Great experience overall.,False,4,"There is one slight hang up:
When submitting a review with multiple pictures, when you press the submit button the app freezes for about 30 seconds giving the user no indication that it is uploading and not locked up. (Might be a shorter delay if you have faster internet)

I think it should at least display a spinning wheel while it is busy uploading instead of being unresponsive. That way the user won’t be tempted to terminate it and lose the review they just wrote.

I will make it 5 stars when I notice a fix in a new update.

Thank you!",2022-11-07 04:38:54,Ra-Pad

3125,Avis,False,1,"Hello dear,

We as moroccan community of buyers from your platform, we are facing a serious problem these days ! 

We want to inform you that your ALIEXPRESS STANDARD SHIPPING to MOROCCO was suspended  by your platform without a convincing reason
And we noticed that free shipping is no longer a choice among the choices that sellers gives. 

We still receive some packages and that proves that our government has no hand in restricting/refusing to receive parcels from China 
And many shipping companies like “ SUNYOU-SF PARCEL-CAINIAO -YANWEN-POSTNL Singapore “ still shipping to MOROCCO until now.

Though, our neighbors countries such as ( Algeria, Tunisia ) and also the rest of world , do have the "" AliExpress Standard shipping and free shipping "" choice.
We Would be highly grateful if you could look into the matter and take actions.

Looking forward to your reply within shortest time",2021-08-15 16:44:43,mdoxi

3141,"Used to be great, now it’s just junk",False,1,"Used to buy stuff from this app all the time, had a constant flow of things being delivered.

But in the past few months it’s just terrible. Nothing gets delivered, had to dispute almost everything, and the recommendations are horrible.

To make matters worse, everything has hidden shipping fees now, that are often more expensive than the item itself. A phone case for $5? Awesome. A phone case for $5 with $30+ shipping that still takes 3 months? Yeah no.

It’s always trying to recommend Chinese herbs or stones, adult toys, goat horn cutters, or incredibly expensive things I’ve never been interested in in my life.

Don’t know what happened to this app. Used to spend hundreds of dollars a year on gifts and knick knacks, now I’m considering deleting it.",2021-01-14 12:54:48,trebory6

So far I bought too many items and truly mentioned the ones I received. This is the second time happening to me. At the first time I didn't even put it on dispute, but this second one was a gift to my friend. Sorry AliExpress. Will pay more but won't buy lt from you as often as it was before.

Many things are very cheap, sometimes you’ll get something extra that you didn’t order. Don’t buy makeup/skincare from here. Many fake products but usually it’s pretty easy to tell (don’t be stupid, stupid).

3149,Fraud?,False,1,"I am a very patient person.  However, this app has given me nothing but a headache.  The reason being that most of the sellers specifically ‘foreverlilly store’ is a red flag and will send you a defected item and close the dispute before you have a chance to even open it.  The company does not even have a customer service number (most likely due to the high volume of complaints).  If you choose to use this app because the deal seems to good to be true. IT IS!

Oh yea and a refund? Yea you can forget about that because they refuse to give you one, even if it’s been 6 months they tell you to wait longer.

Half the things on the website are out of stock but they still let you purchase it. I don’t get that. I think it’s best for me to just stop buying from there.

3216,App a bit confusing & are plugs compatible w/ countries,False,3,Things are grouped quite oddly and sadly there’s not a lot of information if the plugs are all compatible in the UK or US which is a huge deterrent with purchasing... not sure if they’re not compatible but no one wants to wait for some thing and then when it finally gets here you can’t use it in your country! Unsure if I’m going to end up buying anything now 😫,2020-11-29 15:14:13,yourgirlferrari

3219,Rhonda,False,4,Lots of fun ordering. The only complaint is the dispute process. I did not receive a product although the store said they sent it. I understand things get lost. It is a long way from China to my house. It was only finger nail polish but the store wanted me to check with the post office and all my neighbors. They insisted I remove the dispute and I did but I did not get a replacement,2020-08-31 08:58:32,enkii57
3220,White wax glue,False,5,I recommend the white wax because it works good I was fool because I thought it would be just OK like the pink wax but something about this keeps the drills on an easy to pick up.

Most of the time it takes a month and a few days, but if it’s been longer, at least they give you the option for a refund.",2020-07-13 15:27:52,notsoraven

3227,Hmmm,False,1,"Dispute process reason selection is very limited and bias in favor of the seller. It’s a gamble buying from AliExpress. If it’s Chinese New Year these guys abandon their business completely. That’s just bad business practice. 

When searching thru pages getting back to home page you will have to swipe right or click left arrow several time to accomplish. Occasionally there is a drop down menu upper right corner but most of the time it’s a real effort to return to home page to find account or search page etc.",2020-05-21 16:03:41,Wmontg5988
3228,Unsatisfied Customer,False,3,The communication between AliExpress and Customers is not satisfied. They only listen to the salesperson and the customer is not listened to. You buy a different product and they send something different and AliExpress will not look into it.

If I ordered any thing I should have the guaranteed that I will received it.,2020-05-13 00:18:28,Shoe Gone Wrong

Love it!",2019-12-19 22:24:22,CaliLove85
3235,Great deals...but confusing,False,3,There are great deals in here...but I find their system very confusing.  I was drawn by a $2 coupon for new uses that I never got or got to use.

I can buy coupons from coins I earn...but I’m still unsure of the different ways I earn coins...what kind of coupons I can buy...and when any coupons would apply.,2020-01-29 07:20:39,Tigerboy808
3236,Great Stuff 4 less,False,5,"My frd recommended this app to me. Ever since i downloaded the app, im receiving package every other week. The only thg is that sometimes shipping can take more than 3 wks. If u order sth for a holiday, make sure u do it ahead of time.

3239,Don’t do 11:11 sales,False,3,Normally 11:11 sales are suppose to be cheaper but it isn’t cos they increase their prices then quote it’s cheaper to claim it’s on sales. Got an item about two weeks before sales for 110$. By 11:11 I saw same item for 125$ but on sale for 110$. Cos I wanted to rebuy. I was like no need and because of the amount of orders there is a lot of orders.. they misplace a lot of items a lot of delays getting items up to 2 months.

The Eversilky Store refuses to acknowledge they mixed information, forcing the error and denying the issue. There is no way through the app that I’ve found to report and get support or satisfaction.

3304,Gems are hard to find,False,3,"Communication is difficult.  If they even respond.  There are no guidelines in which AliExpress expects of their seller. Forget trying to dispute or return crappy, not shown in sales picture items. You’ll end up eating cost.  In addition, a lot of fakes on here which they claim to be “designer”. And charge high designer prices.  Don’t trust this site. DH Gate and Banggood are more expensive but much much more honest. And reliable",2020-11-24 14:21:48,Family and Divorce

3310,Please do not waste your money here.,False,1,"Yes the prices are amazing but the stores do not communicate, the tracking numbers are fake, they take money with no plan of sending the item or refunding anyone involved.

3312,Pay less but long shipping,False,4,"The app reminds me of Wish. But this app actually makes me feel like I can trust it more than Wish. Because you can communicate with the seller and I only contacted one and it was a very fast reply. The system seems like it meets both the seller and customer’s satisfaction. 

But overall, I like this app. The items are very low price and some items are cheaply made.

The only thing I don’t like is how long the delivery is. It takes a month or 2+.

I got bought an item around April 20 and got it today at May 20. But not the other items that I bought on the same day. So they all may come separately.",2020-05-20 22:42:01,Trinnniiiii

I had a package go to the wrong address and instead of them just refunding my money so that I can re-purchase to the correct address I’m going in circles with both AliExpress and the store I purchased from. AliExpress was supposed to step and with a solution over 4 days ago and nothing!! And this is not the 1st time I’ve had an issue with this company! I’ll just stick with WISH next time!!!,2019-06-26 13:26:19,Brittany Monae

3343,Sometimes gives refund but mostly No,False,1,"Never again am I going to spend my money on an app that requires me to prove that I didn’t receive an item from a seller. How am I supposed to prove something so ignorant like that? If it was never delivered to my door. Also AliExpress said I didn’t pick it up from my post office, I don’t even own a POBOX, I used my home address for the delivery! Worst buyer experience ever.

3353,Lots of cute stuff but it’s abused too much,False,3,"A lot of the stuff I see on here is sold my sellers in America for a higher price. A lot of clothes that isn’t good for the workers or environment is sold on here.

3359,Great App….sometimes…,False,4,I love all the great stuff you can find on this app. Sometimes the quality isn’t up to the description though.

The same camera was available for $20 in eBay while They sold that for 157 to me. I told and gave proofs to AliExpress that everything is on BIOS, but they believed only the seller and finished the dispute.
Therefore never ever buy anything if that is for more than $25. AliExpress is good only for less expensive stuff.

3403,App needs improvement,False,2,"Pretty decent app, but there is room for improvements: 

1) More categories when searching by photo. 
2) Once you look at something, it keeps popping up too often thinking it will trick you (but not really). 
3) All the games are silly..it’s a shopping app..
4) Get rid of that 3 second advertisement on start up! So irritating! I have stopped using the app a lot because of this!

Otherwise, there are quite a number of convenient  features: that there is feedback (Ebay doesn’t have), tracking feature, search by photo option works decently & is handy, but could improve, the communication option with sellers is nice and it’s easy to work out any issues.  

I hope this app continues to improve. Thanks.",2020-01-27 21:27:43,Rooooooooooooooo123

In terms of underwear: find two 100% identical items. However, only able to view one item while the other blocked??? Gives Alert = “OOPS item is blocked/banned in your home country. ~paraphrasing~” 
↕️
Doesn’t make sense when looking at other separate items that show excessive  graphic content, but they’re accessible?? (Those are the items that should be blocked/banned, or you would think that would be the case at lease.)????

3547,Endless options,False,5,Shipping time is my only con for AliExpress but that usually happens when you buy direct from any company in China.

You will never be able to change your registered phone on AliExpress, I tried all the options available on their website but they are all useless! 

Eva (their automated online customer service) is just a waste of time!

I spoke with human customer service, they asked me to submit a form via mail/post (which I consider an archaic way), I did long time ago but they never resolved the issue.

Worst experience ever on a shopping platform!",2022-08-10 15:22:02,B_Mohamed

3551,"Some product is not sold as described, shipping takes long time, hard to return",False,1,"Pro: some product can be a lot cheaper.

Con:
1.  The seller shows a good looking product.  Then in color choices, they provide you to select a completely different product in a small image.

2.  Shipping takes 1 month or more because it ships from China. Sometimes you already forget you have ordered a product.

3.  Return is very difficult.  Aliexpress doesn’t give you a choice to return.

4.  There is no customer service email or phone number.  Or I had hard time to find.

Conclusion 
Avoid aliexpress 99% of time.  Don’t buy anything expensive here.   If you are not sure whether to buy or not, don’t buy because you can not return.",2022-07-26 12:26:33,Thomas113437

A T-Shirt
And two small electronic items priced at only $5 for one and $80 for the other
The t-shirt was sent from New York State and arrived shortly after purchase the two other items never arrived and their “dispute” policies are insane
Your window to report missing items is months after purchase and very small and even if you and the tracking can PROVE you never received the goods you paid for AliExpress can haggle you down to whatever they want to give you back
They don’t give you all of what you paid they negotiated me (strong armed basically I didn’t have a choice) into accepting only $25 for the $85 in unshipped items.

We as moroccan community of buyers from your platform, we are facing a serious problem these days ! 

We want to inform you that your ALIEXPRESS STANDARD SHIPPING to MOROCCO was suspended  by your platform without a convincing reason
And we noticed that free shipping is no longer a choice among the choices that sellers gives. 

We still receive some packages and that proves that our government has no hand in restricting/refusing to receive parcels from China 
And many shipping companies like “ SUNYOU-SF PARCEL-CAINIAO -YANWEN-POSTNL Singapore “ still shipping to MOROCCO until now.

Though, our neighbors countries such as ( Algeria, Tunisia ) and also the rest of world , do have the "" AliExpress Standard shipping and free shipping "" choice.
We Would be highly grateful if you could look into the matter and take actions.

Looking forward to your reply within shortest time",2020-12-01 23:05:28,Bwjwjkekdldldiiekndkdjdkd

4186,Numerous Vendors are Scammers,False,1,"With my experience, most of the products I’ve ordered here have ended up being scams where the items are fake are not as described. The worst part about it is you can’t predict which is a scam versus which isn’t. And after you do get scammed, their support team is atrocious and begins with a bot.

Then it’s a fight to see if you get your money back.  The last item I ordered said delivered to a whole different state than I live let alone to my house.  They denied my dispute.  I’ve been hearing this is quite common the more often you order the less likely you are to get your items and will not get a refund.,2020-01-28 04:04:00,Abrown14

4210,Does the job. But not well,False,2,"If you know exactly what something is called, you can find it. If not, very hit or miss. 

The cart and purchase process is clunky but capable. 

Dealing with orders and confirming receipt is doable, though again, the user interface needs work. 

The two big issues I have with this app are: 1) the review process for vendors needs to be improved. And there needs to be a PRODUCT review as well, separate from the vendor. 

Also, if you have an issue with a vendor, good luck getting it corrected. I just assume I will lose about 20% of my money on orders for which I am unable to get a refund for either never sending the product or sending the wrong product or the product is a piece of junk.",2019-12-01 20:20:18,Kel3001

sellers can extend the delivery window and you can‘t do anything but wait until that window is over but before it ends they extend it again and so on. No way to get help from Alibaba.

4325,Needs better buyer protection,False,4,For the most part I have great items with timely shipping.

4326,Customer,False,4,I love the huge variety of item. The disadvantages is that sellers can send us wrong sizes and talk crazy to customers and we can’t get refund and little assistance.

4341,Review of AliExpress,False,5,I really enjoy purchasing from AliExpress. I can find some unusual items that I can’t get locally. The ap is getting better being user friendly.

4342,Review APP,False,3,"Many stores don’t care if you get the product you bought. Many stores don’t care about customer service or when you ask to cancel or refund money. I get only the 80% of what I bought and paid already. Sometimes, products are so cheap lol that make me laugh out loud. Few stores are very nice and sell what they promise, just so few of them.",2020-04-13 22:22:57,Ferpilokina

4344,Hair review,False,5,The hair was very soft and true to length. But it could’ve been more full. The closure is beautiful and it came with two parts just as I ordered it.

4346,Ive become an Ali Express Addict,False,5,"Lots of fun deals to be found. Shipping takes a while so be prepared to wait. Returns are not straight forward.

4347,Very good shopping app!!!,False,4,I love buying in this app. I didn’t put 5 stars because the only thing that I don’t like of this app is that you have to wait a lot of time to request a refund.

4350,Do not order from here,False,1,I am very disappointed in this app! I ordered hair from here it took my two weeks to talk to anyone about my order I never received my money back after complaining with the vendor and AliExpress once I put in my Dispute they gave me three days to contact Fed ex with proof I hadn’t received my hair. Which is hard to do with this time of the year! They contacted me back when I had three days left on my order protection I advise anyone not to order anything from here!!! They are so horrible.,2019-11-28 18:53:09,Jaiglhvvv01455
4351,App better than online,False,5,The return/cancelation process online MAKES you get the app to be able to cancel. I disliked that. The app is a great easy process but with limited memory on a phone it makes it difficult if you can’t get the app.,2019-11-07 19:31:13,KikiStev

4359,The app is good but the service and management are not good!,False,1,I’ve just started buying stuffs from this app for about 2 months but I had 3 times the sellers return the money because the item was shipped to different address. When I bought products I expect to receive them not just paying someone and wait for 4-8 weeks and get a money back. The management of the website/services should consider adjusting their policies to help the buying not wasting their time.,2019-07-16 23:59:25,Steven20052009
4360,Tempting to ordered again,False,5,This app is very friendly. You can asked directly to the supplier with very fast response.

4370,"Best Deals on Beauty (makeup, nails and wigs)",False,5,Honestly I don't buy my wigs or extensions anywhere else.

4726,Worst app. Worst customer service.,False,1,"My items never arrived, I contacted the seller and they told me to keep waiting. Even after my package was marked “delivered” weeks ago. Contacted AliExpress about a refund. They told me I needed to prove I didn’t have the package. Uhm, hello? It’s not here? Why would I go through all this trouble if it was??? Completely garbage responses. Suggested I interrogate my neighbors and the parcel service the seller used! Unprofessional and unintelligent. I’d give zero stars if I could.",2021-04-17 04:12:59,RayneTwilight
4727,Heavy duty,False,5,"I purchased the iron man that goes on a push button start and it is better than i imagined. Good quality, heavy duty, not the plastic type you find that will break in a week. Highly recommend for your iron man fan",2021-03-24 17:41:23,Melmcgraw

4729,Good system,False,5,This is an easy to use app and has a lot of perks. Only issue is sometimes there are bad sellers who don’t send product. This is still my preferred way of ordering bulk product without a resellers license.,2021-03-19 01:32:05,#%^*%^*
4730,Sizes it’s too small,False,5,Your company has a good variety of choices. The only problem is the largest sizes do not fit a North American clientele. Unfortunately larger clients are not considered in your size inventory. That really should be a main consideration for your company,2021-03-04 05:20:50,Demoncar007
4731,Very disappointed,False,1,"Have made quite a few purchases and there have been quite a few that have arrived damaged. I find it that often times, specially when the buyer has paid a lot of money, if there is a problem and a dispute is sent to AliExpress, they will deny your dispute in a heart bit. Most likely without reading the allegations or looking at the pictures provided. Nice technique for putting more money in their pockets.",2021-03-05 02:58:34,"chiertuion m,,l"

4739,Horrible Tracking and Shipping,False,1,The app is overall great. But the shipping and tracking is horrible. I’ve had to message each seller numerous times because of packages that were supposed to be delivered before the estimated shipping and I’ve most of the time got no response back. The prices are amazing and hard to pass up. Most of the products that’s I’ve purchased have taken about 4 months over estimated delivery to arrive.,2021-01-15 09:43:57,mweiand17

4756,Hard to use,False,2,Navigation and search is clumsy at best. The prices of items is deceiving. The advertised price is always the lowest end of a group of items where the one shown in the product listing (the true item) will be 2x-5x more expensive then the advertised price. Obviously this is some marketing gimmick. The lottery games are extremely annoying have no core value. The recommendations have no relevance to my habits.,2020-08-09 10:33:39,Nicknameaaaaabbbbcccc
4757,Easy to use,False,5,"The new version of the app is very easy to use and navigate.

So I ordered this makeup bag a while back and when I checked back on the order, it said something like ‘canceled’ and I was like “why does it say canceled” and I contacted the seller and they said that “I” canceled the order. Obviously I did not. But, I didn’t think much of it until I checked my bank account and it didn’t refund it AT ALL!! I swear I’m gonna order something and if it doesn’t go through and give me a refund I will be FURIOUS!",2020-06-13 23:58:06,Arjayjay

I contacted the seller who has not sent my product or given me a refund. I tried to contact the apps help center but I still have not gotten my money back nor have they tried to resend the product. I’ve been fighting back and fourth for 2 months and still nothing has happened. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS APP,2020-05-25 09:48:42,SukYoDik

None of the items arrived within the time frames promised so I requested my additional shipping fees returned, as the only reason I paid extra for shipping was to receive the items faster. They side with seller EVERY time. Doesn’t matter that you’re right. Beware, if there is a dispute, you will lose!",2018-01-29 13:54:17,Mimo 07

I received other items from China in 1 week from other vendors. I ended up having to purchase something else.

You want me to return the item to China by paying $75 dollars for each when you have a store house in NY. Does it make business sense to you to pay that amount of money which is more the the cost of one of the item and 80% of the other.

I filed package inquiries with USPS and received an email from them today that both packages were lost due to bad shipping labels. I contacted the sellers and asked for refunds, I included the email from USPS. The sellers responses:

Why they think it lost? It still in transit.

I filed a dispute through AliExpress, which included the email from USPS. They deemed that I was ineligible for a refund because the sellers lied and told them that I received the packages. I don’t understand why the sellers words somehow carry more weight than an agency of the US government.

I had to contact my bank in order to reverse the charges.

I will delete the app and not use AliExpress again.",2020-08-18 13:02:21,JillyBean42

The sellers will call you past midnight and at least 30x back to back but once you ask a question they block you. 
They do NOT honor their refund policy. I ordered something a month ago and it’s still not here yet on the web saying completed and delivered and has for two weeks now. 
AliExpress days they will step in but once they did they cancelled my dispute and started another one sayin return a product that isn’t here.

5805,Warning Bonus Buddies cheating,False,3,I have spun the bonus buddies but every day it subtracts from my total so that it doesn’t reach $200 to be able to cash out.

5817,Love/Hate,False,1,"I love the service but I hate the app. 

1. Search: All search terms are seen as OR with no way to require (or exclude) a term.

2. App will always show cheapest shipping cost in searches even if that shipping method is not available to your country.

3. Sort: There is no way to sort by total cost (item plus shipping).

4. Deception: App allows vendors to list different items under the same product listing, so of course many vendors will advertise cost of one item while describing and showing pictures of a different item.

Overall the app (and site) are horrible but AliExpress doesn’t care because people continue to use it, so it will probably never get better.",2021-12-25 16:58:28,λανθάνος
